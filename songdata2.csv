ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true

ABBA,Bang,/a/abba/bang_20598415.html,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch

Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra

ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

ABBA,Crazy World,/a/abba/crazy+world_20003013.html,"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world

Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please

ABBA,Fernando,/a/abba/fernando_20002896.html,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.

Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays

Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
