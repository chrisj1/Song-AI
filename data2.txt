textlook at her face, it's a wonderful face  
and it means something special to me  
look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
how lucky can one fellow be?  
  
she's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
she's just my kind of girl, without her i'm blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?  
  
and when we go for a walk in the park  
and she holds me and squeezes my hand  
we'll go on walking for hours and talking  
about all the things that we plan  
  
she's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
she's just my kind of girl, without her i'm blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?

take it easy with me, please  
touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
take your time, make it slow  
andante, andante  
just let the feeling grow  
  
make your fingers soft and light  
let your body be the velvet of the night  
touch my soul, you know how

play me time and time again and make me strong  
(play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
make me sing, make me sound  
(you make me sing and you make me)  
andante, andante  
tread lightly on my ground  
andante, andante  
oh please don't let me down  
  
there's a shimmer in your eyes  
like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
please don't talk, go on, play  
andante, andante  
and let me float away  
  
i'm your music  
(i am your music and i am your song)  
i'm your song  
(i am your music and i am your song)  
play me time and time again and make me strong

saying i don't need you anymore, i've had enough  
and now, look at me standing here again 'cause i found out that  
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
gotta have you near  
  
as good as new, my love for you  
and keeping it that way is my intention  
as good as new and growing too

it's as good as new, my love for you  
just like it used to be and even better  
as good as new, thank god it's true  
darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
how could i make such a dumb mistake  
now i know i'm not entitled to another break  
but please, baby, i beg you to forgive 'cause i found out that  
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
gotta get you near

and keeping it that way is my intention  
as good as new and growing too

as good as new, thank god it's true  
darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
yes the love i have for you feels as good as new  
darling, we were always meant to stay together

making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
you can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
every smile and every little touch  
don't you know that they mean so much  
sweet sweet kisses so tender  
always will return to sender  
  
like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
so give it away, i think you'll learn  
you'll get love in return  
so bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
when you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
never use it as a selfish tool  
never ever be such a fool  
every feeling you're showing  
is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
so give it away, i think you'll learn  
you'll get love in return  
so bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
and if you're warm and tender  
i'll kiss you, return to sender  
please surrender  
  
bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
