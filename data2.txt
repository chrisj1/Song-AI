and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?  
  
and when we go for a walk in the park  
and she holds me and squeezes my hand  
we'll go on walking for hours and talking  
about all the things that we plan  
  
she's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
she's just my kind of girl, without her i'm blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?

when you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
never use it as a selfish tool

every feeling you're showing  
is a boomerang you're throwing

well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
and i've always been under your heel  
holy christ what a lousy deal  
now i'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
and i ain't gonna take it no more  
oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
once again i wanna look into the eye  
being myself  
counting my pride  
no un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
burning my bridges  
moving at last  
girl i'm leaving and i'm burying the past  
gonna have peace now  
you can be free  
no one here will make a sucker out of me

down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
staying alive though the city is dead  
hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
while you are crying alone on your bed  
  
pity cassandra that no one believed you  
but then again you were lost from the start  
now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights  
nobody knew how to fight  
and we were caught in our sleep  
sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
so in the morning your ship will be sailing  
now that your father and sister are gone  
there is no reason for you to linger  
you're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
you know the future is casting a shadow  
no one else sees it but you know your fate  
packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights  
nobody knew how to fight  
and we were caught in our sleep  
sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
she stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights

sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave

i'm sorry cassandra  
i'm sorry cassandra

chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
you're enchained by your own sorrow  
in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
how i hate to see you like this  
there is no way you can deny it  
i can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
chiquitita, tell me the truth  
i'm a shoulder you can cry on  
your best friend, i'm the one you must rely on  
you were always sure of yourself  
now i see you've broken a feather  
i hope we can patch it up together  
  
chiquitita, you and i know  
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
you will have no time for grieving  
chiquitita, you and i cry  
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
  
so the walls came tumbling down  
and your love's a blown out candle  
all is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
chiquitita, tell me the truth  
there is no way you can deny it  
i see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
chiquitita, you and i know  
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
you will have no time for grieving  
chiquitita, you and i cry  
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita

i was out with the morning sun  
couldn't sleep, so i thought i'd take a walk  
i was thinking of you and me  
and i went to your house, 'cause i had to talk  
  
i could hardly believe my eyes  
when i saw this guy closing your front door  
had the feeling of emptiness like i never had before  
and i closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
as he disapeared in his car  
i was stunned and i didn't know what to do  
everything i had ever dreamed  
  
everything in my life's part of you  
and i just couldn't move my feet  
so i stood on the pavement as you came out  
you acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
and i closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
baby, how could you do it  
you just told me lies  
  
and you meet behind my back  
with other guys  
baby, how could you tell me  
there was only me  
  
i was stupid to believe you  
i was blind but now i see  
then you smiled and you took my hand  
"there is something", you said, "that you may not know  
  
there's a couple of men in my life  
and one of them is my brother joe  
he's been gone for a long, long time  
but he's back and i think he's gonna stay  
  
you'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"  
then i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
so i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
so i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world

i'm waitin' for you baby  
i'm sitting all alone  
i feel so cold without you

i never thought you'd leave me  
but now i know it's true  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
i'm waitin' for you baby  
i'm sittin' all alone  
i feel so cold without you  
it chills me to the bone  
i never thought you'd leave me  
but now i know it's true

i'm cryin' over you  
  
cryin' over you  
i'm cryin' over you  
cryin' over  
little memories of things we used to do  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you

oh, my love it makes me sad.  
why did things turn out so bad?  
was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
baby, give me one more  
dance while the music still goes on  
don't think about tomorrow  
dance and forget our time is gone  
tonight's a night we borrow.  
let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
a thing to remember when we're all alone  
so dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
yes, all we have to do is  
dance while the music still goes on  
this is no time for crying  
dance, don't you hear them play our song  
god knows that we've been trying  
but we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
we just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
so dance while the music still goes on  
and let it be our last goodbye  
  
yet it seems to make me sad.  
why did things turn out so bad?  
was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
baby, give me one last  
dance while the music still goes on  
just like the night i met you  
dance and believe me, when you're gone  
you know i won't forget you  
our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
you tell me it's over, what more can i say?  
so dance while the music still goes on  
it's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
dance while the music still goes on  
don't think about tomorrow  
dance and forget our time is gone  
tonight's a night we borrow.  
let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
a thing to remember when we're all alone  
so dance while the music still goes on  
and let it be our last goodbye  
  
dance while the music still goes on  
this is no time for crying  
dance, don't you hear them play our song  
god knows that we've been trying  
dance while the music still goes on  
just like the night i met you  
dance and believe me, when you're gone  
you know i won't forget you

you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen  
  
friday night and the lights are low  
looking out for the place to go  
where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
you come in to look for a king  
anybody could be that guy  
night is young and the music's high  
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
you're in the mood for a dance  
and when you get the chance  
  
you are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen  
  
you're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
leave them burning and then you're gone  
looking out for another, anyone will do  
you're in the mood for a dance  
and when you get the chance  
  
you are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen

changing, moving in a circle  
i can see your face in all of my dreams  
smiling, laughing from the shadows  
when i hear your voice, i know what it means  
i know it doesn't matter just how hard i try  
you're all the reason for my life  
  
disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
how can i forget you when my world is breaking down  
you're all i had, you're all i want  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have  
  
wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
did i see your face somewhere in the crowd  
thinking, wondering what you're doing  
i can't stop myself from crying out loud  
they say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
but then, they never shared our love  
  
disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
how can i forget you when my world is breaking down  
you're all i had, you're all i want  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have  
  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have

you're so hot, teasing me  
so you're blue but i can't take a chance on a chick like you  
that's something i couldn't do  
there's that look in your eyes  
i can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild  
ah, but girl you're only a child

does your mother know that you're out?

take it easy (take it easy)  
try to cool it girl

but you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun  
so maybe i'm not the one

and i know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)  
but girl you're only a child

playing night and day, wo-oh  
and it sounds better now, yes you improve  
everytime you play, wo-oh  
but it's bad  
you're so sad  
and you're only smiling  
when you play your violin  
  
dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
to be so near you and not just hear you  
dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
i think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
you'd be mine  
and we'd be together all the time  
wish i was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
but i think, you don't know that i exist  
i'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
from the day when i first listened to you  
you've been on my mind, wo-oh

it's not fair

they came flying from far away, now i'm under their spell  
i love hearing the stories that they tell  
they've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
they speak strangely but i understand  
  
and i dream i'm an eagle  
and i dream i can spread my wings  
flying high, high, i'm a bird in the sky  
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
high, high, what a feeling to fly  
over mountains and forests and seas  
and to go anywhere that i please  
  
as all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
i have questions and they know everything  
there's no limit to what i feel, we climb higher and higher  
am i dreaming or is it all real?  
  
is it true i'm an eagle?  
is it true i can spread my wings?  
flying high, high, i'm a bird in the sky (i'm an eagle)  
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
high, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)  
over mountains and forests and seas  
and to go anywhere that i please

every good man needs a helping hand  
so i travel alone if i can  
every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
living on the dark side once again  
it's sad to lose a friend  
looking at things with empty feelings  
still we're going on  
  
for every good man needs a helping hand  
i should have known too  
some of us learn too late, i'm sorry  
every good man needs a helping hand  
it's true

can you hear the drums fernando?  
i remember long ago another starry night like this  
in the firelight fernando  
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
i could hear the distant drums  
and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
they were closer now fernando  
every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
i was so afraid fernando  
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
and i'm not ashamed to say  
the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
there was something in the air that night  
the stars were bright, fernando  
they were shining there for you and me  
for liberty, fernando  
though i never thought that we could lose  
there's no regret  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
  
now we're old and grey fernando  
and since many years i haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
can you hear the drums fernando?  
do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande?  
i can see it in your eyes  
how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(repeat x2)  
there was something in the air that night  
the stars were bright, fernando  
they were shining there for you and me  
for liberty, fernando  
though i never thought that we could lose  
there's no regret  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
  
yes, if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando...

puedes escuchar fernando?  
me recuerda tiempo atras  
estrellas y una noche alla  
en la lumbre azul fernando  
tarareabas tu cancion  
con ese suave guitarrear  
yo podia escuchar  
esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
se acercaban mas fernando  
y el momento que pasaba  
parecia eternidad  
y senti temor fernando  
por la vida y juventud  
nadie pensaba en morir  
y no siento hoy verguenza al  
confesar que tuve  
ganas de llorar  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
la vejez llego fernando  
y con ella una paz  
que hoy logramos disfrutar  
se durmio el tambor fernando  
paraciera que fue ayer  
que lo vivimos tu y yo  
y en tus ojos veo aun  
aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
[repeata y "fade"]

i'm down and i feel depressed  
sitting here just waiting  
for next bus travelling  
downtown  
it's a crying shame  
isn't it  
the beautiful weather  
if i could have my way  
well, i would not be working  
on a day like this i know what i'd like to be  
as free as a bumble bee  
take a sip from  
every flower  
free as a bumble bee  
while away each lazy hour  
what a good life  
lying laid back  
like an old railroad bum by the track  
what a good life  
living outdoors  
lie in the grass and chew on a straw

twinkle, twinkle little star  
how i wonder what you are  
like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
seems to me you shine your light  
down to me to say goodnight  
twinkle, twinkle my old friend  
sleep is waiting round the bend  
while you travel through the milky way  
from afar  
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle little star.  
  
raindrops on a window pane  
stillness of a summer rain  
silently the haze drifts through the trees  
slowly dawn is breaking through  
yet a morning without you  
  
curtins rustling in the breeze  
i'm still trapped within my dreams  
daylight makes it's way into my mind  
coming through  
yet another morning without you.  
  
finally when darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes backs to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
mmm, mmm, mmm- echoes of a voice i knew  
  
half awake in half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room.  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
long awaited darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warms my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes back to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
half awake and half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  
like an angel passing through my room.

half past twelve  
and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
how i hate to spend the evening on my own  
autumn winds  
blowing outside my window as i look around the room  
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
movie stars  
find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
it's so different from the world i'm living in  
tired of t. v.  
i open the window and i gaze into the night  
but there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

there's a gentleness to everything you do  
and it's rubbing off on me i feel it too  
i've been waiting but my loneliness i get  
when you call me on the phone  
and i'm feeling so alone  
when you ask me to come over  
baby you know i will  
i could never stay on my own  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more

you say she's been mad at you  
then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
still i see that she makes you blue  
come on, i'll give you consolation  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
you're all i ever need, my darling  
  
just to be where you want to be  
so much fun we could have then, hmm  
to be close for eternity  
what a miracle to happen  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
gonna sing you my love song, when i think about you  
i know she doesn't make it easy  
'cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
you're my life, you're my angel  
you're my first, you're my last  
would she care if you lingered  
for another night  
want to hold you tight  
we could make it right  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
i know she doesn't make it easy  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
gonna sing you my love song, when i think about you  
you're all i ever need, my darling  
and i would love to sing my love song  
for you

when the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
when the air gets cold then i think of us  
of you and i  
and it almost makes me cry  
so sad and kind of bitter sweet  
and the memories filled with tears  
and i feel my heart will break  
guess it all was my mistake  
  
autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
the rain fell softly on your face  
oh i remember every little thing about that day  
i remember every place  
grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
the rain fell softly on your face  
the memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
i never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

agnetha, frida early this morning i drove in the rain  
out to the airport to get on the plain  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
after all i had to go through, i'm making no plans  
but i, but i believe love gives me a second chance  
  
guess i've been working a little to hard  
need a vacation, i'll send you a card  
from honolulu, a greeting from happy hawaii  
it's so exciting, why should i pretend  
  
in a few hours the plane will descend  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
i can imagine the beach and the sand  
walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
after all i had to go through, i'm making no plans  
but i, but i believe love gives me a second chance  
i've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
someone is waiting and i forget you  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii

no more champagne  
and the fireworks are through  
here we are, me and you  
feeling lost and feeling blue  
it's the end of the party  
and the morning seems so grey  
so unlike yesterday  
now's the time for us to say  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i  
  
sometimes i see  
how the brave new world arrives  
and i see how it thrives  
in the ashes of our lives  
oh yes, man is a fool  
and he thinks he'll be okay  
dragging on, feet of clay  
never knowing he's astray  
keeps on going anyway  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i  
  
seems to me now  
that the dreams we had before  
are all dead, nothing more  
than confetti on the floor  
it's the end of a decade  
in another ten years time  
who can say what we'll find  
what lies waiting down the line  
in the end of eighty-nine  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i

benny i was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
and my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
but then it happened one night  
as i got into a fight  
i could hear someone saying  
as though he was praying  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
on the road  
that we're going  
we all need  
words of comfort and compassion  
treat him well, he is your brother  
love him, that's the only way  
  
i was a woman, never thinking of others  
and my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
but then i happened to meet  
a begging man in the street  
as i turned down his praying  
i heard someone saying  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
on the road  
that we're going  
we all need  
words of comfort and compassion  
treat him well, he is your brother  
love him, that's the only way  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way

i have a very good friend  
the kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
she has a personal style  
some people love it others tend to go wild  
you hear her voice everywhere  
taking the chair  
she's a leading lady  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
  
her man is one i admire  
he's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
each time when he speaks his mind  
she pats his head and says that's all very fine  
exert that will of your own  
when you're alone  
now we better hurry  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
  
you hear her voice everywhere  
taking the chair  
she's a leading lady  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
(she's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
and she goes  
head over heels

love, love is a dream  
we were like two young strands of driftwood  
caught up in a stream  
we were destined for each other  
from our very first hello  
we came bustin' through that river dam  
and made that river flow  
we will sail upon the ocean  
til the shoreline meets the sky  
carried on the first trade wind  
that favours you and i  
we have both of us between us  
known misfortune in our days  
darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
  
life, oh life is a chance  
we were the only two who spun the wheel  
and never scored romance  
if we'd stayed to play for fortune  
we'd have broke the banks of gold  
we'd have taken old las vegas  
for every cent that she could hold  
love like ours was made in heaven  
it was blessed by lord above  
we will spend our lives together  
forever hand in glove  
we have both of us between us  
known misfortune in our days  
darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we won't ever throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
so we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away...

so at last you're free  
it's the way you wanted it to be  
and the price you paid  
to become a woman of today  
is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
does it hurt when they ask for daddy  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
(yes you can)  
  
so you're free at last  
and beginning to forget the past  
does it make you sad  
when you think about the life you ha-ha-had  
but you're right, you had to take a second chance  
so you fight to find your freedom  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
what's the matter with you  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
don't you know what to do  
(yes you do)  
(yes you do yes you do)  
(yes you do yes you do)  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
what's the matter with you  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
don't you know what to do  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)

you feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
when it's bad, worse, worst  
(and when you're feeling so bad)  
and you think you're cursed  
(and you've got it sad)  
well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
my friend sam is a chauffeur, annie goes to school  
jerry works at the office, sue lies by the pool  
but on all weekends  
(together again)  
when i meet my friends  
(i'm gonna see them now)  
and we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
you paint your world and use all colors  
and then you find it all comes out too bright  
you know it's only a lie  
the songs you sing are too romantic  
and when you want the truth  
they only spit in your eye  
oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
you feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
when it's bad, worse, worst  
(you know you're feeling so bad)  
and you think you're cursed  
(and you've got it sad)  
well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul
