and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?  
  
and when we go for a walk in the park  
and she holds me and squeezes my hand  
we'll go on walking for hours and talking  
about all the things that we plan  
  
she's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
she's just my kind of girl, without her i'm blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do, what could i do?

when you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
never use it as a selfish tool

every feeling you're showing  
is a boomerang you're throwing

well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
and i've always been under your heel  
holy christ what a lousy deal  
now i'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
and i ain't gonna take it no more  
oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
once again i wanna look into the eye  
being myself  
counting my pride  
no un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
burning my bridges  
moving at last  
girl i'm leaving and i'm burying the past  
gonna have peace now  
you can be free  
no one here will make a sucker out of me

down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
staying alive though the city is dead  
hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
while you are crying alone on your bed  
  
pity cassandra that no one believed you  
but then again you were lost from the start  
now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights  
nobody knew how to fight  
and we were caught in our sleep  
sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
so in the morning your ship will be sailing  
now that your father and sister are gone  
there is no reason for you to linger  
you're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
you know the future is casting a shadow  
no one else sees it but you know your fate  
packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights  
nobody knew how to fight  
and we were caught in our sleep  
sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
she stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights

sorry cassandra i didn't believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave

i'm sorry cassandra  
i'm sorry cassandra

chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
you're enchained by your own sorrow  
in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
how i hate to see you like this  
there is no way you can deny it  
i can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
chiquitita, tell me the truth  
i'm a shoulder you can cry on  
your best friend, i'm the one you must rely on  
you were always sure of yourself  
now i see you've broken a feather  
i hope we can patch it up together  
  
chiquitita, you and i know  
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
you will have no time for grieving  
chiquitita, you and i cry  
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
  
so the walls came tumbling down  
and your love's a blown out candle  
all is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
chiquitita, tell me the truth  
there is no way you can deny it  
i see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
chiquitita, you and i know  
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
you will have no time for grieving  
chiquitita, you and i cry  
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita  
try once more like you did before  
sing a new song, chiquitita

i was out with the morning sun  
couldn't sleep, so i thought i'd take a walk  
i was thinking of you and me  
and i went to your house, 'cause i had to talk  
  
i could hardly believe my eyes  
when i saw this guy closing your front door  
had the feeling of emptiness like i never had before  
and i closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
as he disapeared in his car  
i was stunned and i didn't know what to do  
everything i had ever dreamed  
  
everything in my life's part of you  
and i just couldn't move my feet  
so i stood on the pavement as you came out  
you acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
and i closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
baby, how could you do it  
you just told me lies  
  
and you meet behind my back  
with other guys  
baby, how could you tell me  
there was only me  
  
i was stupid to believe you  
i was blind but now i see  
then you smiled and you took my hand  
"there is something", you said, "that you may not know  
  
there's a couple of men in my life  
and one of them is my brother joe  
he's been gone for a long, long time  
but he's back and i think he's gonna stay  
  
you'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"  
then i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
so i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
then i realized, it's a crazy world  
so i closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
then i realized, it's a crazy world

i'm waitin' for you baby  
i'm sitting all alone  
i feel so cold without you

i never thought you'd leave me  
but now i know it's true  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
i'm waitin' for you baby  
i'm sittin' all alone  
i feel so cold without you  
it chills me to the bone  
i never thought you'd leave me  
but now i know it's true

i'm cryin' over you  
  
cryin' over you  
i'm cryin' over you  
cryin' over  
little memories of things we used to do  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you  
oh lord i'm blue  
i'm cryin' over you

oh, my love it makes me sad.  
why did things turn out so bad?  
was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
baby, give me one more  
dance while the music still goes on  
don't think about tomorrow  
dance and forget our time is gone  
tonight's a night we borrow.  
let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
a thing to remember when we're all alone  
so dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
yes, all we have to do is  
dance while the music still goes on  
this is no time for crying  
dance, don't you hear them play our song  
god knows that we've been trying  
but we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
we just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
so dance while the music still goes on  
and let it be our last goodbye  
  
yet it seems to make me sad.  
why did things turn out so bad?  
was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
baby, give me one last  
dance while the music still goes on  
just like the night i met you  
dance and believe me, when you're gone  
you know i won't forget you  
our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
you tell me it's over, what more can i say?  
so dance while the music still goes on  
it's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
dance while the music still goes on  
don't think about tomorrow  
dance and forget our time is gone  
tonight's a night we borrow.  
let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
a thing to remember when we're all alone  
so dance while the music still goes on  
and let it be our last goodbye  
  
dance while the music still goes on  
this is no time for crying  
dance, don't you hear them play our song  
god knows that we've been trying  
dance while the music still goes on  
just like the night i met you  
dance and believe me, when you're gone  
you know i won't forget you

you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen  
  
friday night and the lights are low  
looking out for the place to go  
where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
you come in to look for a king  
anybody could be that guy  
night is young and the music's high  
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
you're in the mood for a dance  
and when you get the chance  
  
you are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen  
  
you're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
leave them burning and then you're gone  
looking out for another, anyone will do  
you're in the mood for a dance  
and when you get the chance  
  
you are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen

changing, moving in a circle  
i can see your face in all of my dreams  
smiling, laughing from the shadows  
when i hear your voice, i know what it means  
i know it doesn't matter just how hard i try  
you're all the reason for my life  
  
disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
how can i forget you when my world is breaking down  
you're all i had, you're all i want  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have  
  
wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
did i see your face somewhere in the crowd  
thinking, wondering what you're doing  
i can't stop myself from crying out loud  
they say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
but then, they never shared our love  
  
disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
how can i forget you when my world is breaking down  
you're all i had, you're all i want  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have  
  
disillusion, disillusions, now that's all i have

you're so hot, teasing me  
so you're blue but i can't take a chance on a chick like you  
that's something i couldn't do  
there's that look in your eyes  
i can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild  
ah, but girl you're only a child

does your mother know that you're out?

take it easy (take it easy)  
try to cool it girl

but you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun  
so maybe i'm not the one

and i know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)  
but girl you're only a child

playing night and day, wo-oh  
and it sounds better now, yes you improve  
everytime you play, wo-oh  
but it's bad  
you're so sad  
and you're only smiling  
when you play your violin  
  
dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
to be so near you and not just hear you  
dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
i think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
you'd be mine  
and we'd be together all the time  
wish i was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
but i think, you don't know that i exist  
i'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
from the day when i first listened to you  
you've been on my mind, wo-oh

it's not fair

they came flying from far away, now i'm under their spell  
i love hearing the stories that they tell  
they've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
they speak strangely but i understand  
  
and i dream i'm an eagle  
and i dream i can spread my wings  
flying high, high, i'm a bird in the sky  
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
high, high, what a feeling to fly  
over mountains and forests and seas  
and to go anywhere that i please  
  
as all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
i have questions and they know everything  
there's no limit to what i feel, we climb higher and higher  
am i dreaming or is it all real?  
  
is it true i'm an eagle?  
is it true i can spread my wings?  
flying high, high, i'm a bird in the sky (i'm an eagle)  
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
high, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)  
over mountains and forests and seas  
and to go anywhere that i please

every good man needs a helping hand  
so i travel alone if i can  
every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
living on the dark side once again  
it's sad to lose a friend  
looking at things with empty feelings  
still we're going on  
  
for every good man needs a helping hand  
i should have known too  
some of us learn too late, i'm sorry  
every good man needs a helping hand  
it's true

can you hear the drums fernando?  
i remember long ago another starry night like this  
in the firelight fernando  
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
i could hear the distant drums  
and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
they were closer now fernando  
every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
i was so afraid fernando  
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
and i'm not ashamed to say  
the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
there was something in the air that night  
the stars were bright, fernando  
they were shining there for you and me  
for liberty, fernando  
though i never thought that we could lose  
there's no regret  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
  
now we're old and grey fernando  
and since many years i haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
can you hear the drums fernando?  
do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande?  
i can see it in your eyes  
how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(repeat x2)  
there was something in the air that night  
the stars were bright, fernando  
they were shining there for you and me  
for liberty, fernando  
though i never thought that we could lose  
there's no regret  
if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando  
  
yes, if i had to do the same again  
i would, my friend, fernando...

puedes escuchar fernando?  
me recuerda tiempo atras  
estrellas y una noche alla  
en la lumbre azul fernando  
tarareabas tu cancion  
con ese suave guitarrear  
yo podia escuchar  
esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
se acercaban mas fernando  
y el momento que pasaba  
parecia eternidad  
y senti temor fernando  
por la vida y juventud  
nadie pensaba en morir  
y no siento hoy verguenza al  
confesar que tuve  
ganas de llorar  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
la vejez llego fernando  
y con ella una paz  
que hoy logramos disfrutar  
se durmio el tambor fernando  
paraciera que fue ayer  
que lo vivimos tu y yo  
y en tus ojos veo aun  
aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
algo habia alrededor quiza  
de claridad fernando  
que brillaba por nosotros dos  
en proteccion fernando  
no pensabamos jamas perder  
ni echar atras  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
lo haria ya fernando  
  
[repeata y "fade"]

i'm down and i feel depressed  
sitting here just waiting  
for next bus travelling  
downtown  
it's a crying shame  
isn't it  
the beautiful weather  
if i could have my way  
well, i would not be working  
on a day like this i know what i'd like to be  
as free as a bumble bee  
take a sip from  
every flower  
free as a bumble bee  
while away each lazy hour  
what a good life  
lying laid back  
like an old railroad bum by the track  
what a good life  
living outdoors  
lie in the grass and chew on a straw

twinkle, twinkle little star  
how i wonder what you are  
like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
seems to me you shine your light  
down to me to say goodnight  
twinkle, twinkle my old friend  
sleep is waiting round the bend  
while you travel through the milky way  
from afar  
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle little star.  
  
raindrops on a window pane  
stillness of a summer rain  
silently the haze drifts through the trees  
slowly dawn is breaking through  
yet a morning without you  
  
curtins rustling in the breeze  
i'm still trapped within my dreams  
daylight makes it's way into my mind  
coming through  
yet another morning without you.  
  
finally when darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes backs to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
mmm, mmm, mmm- echoes of a voice i knew  
  
half awake in half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room.  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
long awaited darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warms my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes back to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
half awake and half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  
like an angel passing through my room.

half past twelve  
and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
how i hate to spend the evening on my own  
autumn winds  
blowing outside my window as i look around the room  
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
movie stars  
find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
it's so different from the world i'm living in  
tired of t. v.  
i open the window and i gaze into the night  
but there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
there's not a soul out there  
no-one to hear my prays  
  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

there's a gentleness to everything you do  
and it's rubbing off on me i feel it too  
i've been waiting but my loneliness i get  
when you call me on the phone  
and i'm feeling so alone  
when you ask me to come over  
baby you know i will  
i could never stay on my own  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more  
when i'm with you  
givin' it all i got to give  
i've never done that before  
i'm always givin' a little more

you say she's been mad at you  
then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
still i see that she makes you blue  
come on, i'll give you consolation  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
you're all i ever need, my darling  
  
just to be where you want to be  
so much fun we could have then, hmm  
to be close for eternity  
what a miracle to happen  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
gonna sing you my love song, when i think about you  
i know she doesn't make it easy  
'cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
you're my life, you're my angel  
you're my first, you're my last  
would she care if you lingered  
for another night  
want to hold you tight  
we could make it right  
  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
i know she doesn't make it easy  
gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
gonna sing you my love song, when i think about you  
you're all i ever need, my darling  
and i would love to sing my love song  
for you

when the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
when the air gets cold then i think of us  
of you and i  
and it almost makes me cry  
so sad and kind of bitter sweet  
and the memories filled with tears  
and i feel my heart will break  
guess it all was my mistake  
  
autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
the rain fell softly on your face  
oh i remember every little thing about that day  
i remember every place  
grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
the rain fell softly on your face  
the memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
i never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

agnetha, frida early this morning i drove in the rain  
out to the airport to get on the plain  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
after all i had to go through, i'm making no plans  
but i, but i believe love gives me a second chance  
  
guess i've been working a little to hard  
need a vacation, i'll send you a card  
from honolulu, a greeting from happy hawaii  
it's so exciting, why should i pretend  
  
in a few hours the plane will descend  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
i can imagine the beach and the sand  
walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii  
after all i had to go through, i'm making no plans  
but i, but i believe love gives me a second chance  
i've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
someone is waiting and i forget you  
hey honolulu, i'm going to happy hawaii

no more champagne  
and the fireworks are through  
here we are, me and you  
feeling lost and feeling blue  
it's the end of the party  
and the morning seems so grey  
so unlike yesterday  
now's the time for us to say  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i  
  
sometimes i see  
how the brave new world arrives  
and i see how it thrives  
in the ashes of our lives  
oh yes, man is a fool  
and he thinks he'll be okay  
dragging on, feet of clay  
never knowing he's astray  
keeps on going anyway  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i  
  
seems to me now  
that the dreams we had before  
are all dead, nothing more  
than confetti on the floor  
it's the end of a decade  
in another ten years time  
who can say what we'll find  
what lies waiting down the line  
in the end of eighty-nine  
  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have a vision now and then  
of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
happy new year  
happy new year  
may we all have our hopes, our will to try  
if we don't we might as well lay down and die  
you and i

benny i was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
and my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
but then it happened one night  
as i got into a fight  
i could hear someone saying  
as though he was praying  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
on the road  
that we're going  
we all need  
words of comfort and compassion  
treat him well, he is your brother  
love him, that's the only way  
  
i was a woman, never thinking of others  
and my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
but then i happened to meet  
a begging man in the street  
as i turned down his praying  
i heard someone saying  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
on the road  
that we're going  
we all need  
words of comfort and compassion  
treat him well, he is your brother  
love him, that's the only way  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way  
  
treat him well, he is your brother  
you might need his help one day  
we depend one one another  
love him, that's the only way

i have a very good friend  
the kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
she has a personal style  
some people love it others tend to go wild  
you hear her voice everywhere  
taking the chair  
she's a leading lady  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
  
her man is one i admire  
he's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
each time when he speaks his mind  
she pats his head and says that's all very fine  
exert that will of your own  
when you're alone  
now we better hurry  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
  
you hear her voice everywhere  
taking the chair  
she's a leading lady  
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
head over heels  
breaking her way  
pushing through unknown jungles every day  
she's a girl with a taste for the world  
(the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
head over heels  
setting the pace  
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
she's extreme if you know what i mean  
(she's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
and she goes  
head over heels

love, love is a dream  
we were like two young strands of driftwood  
caught up in a stream  
we were destined for each other  
from our very first hello  
we came bustin' through that river dam  
and made that river flow  
we will sail upon the ocean  
til the shoreline meets the sky  
carried on the first trade wind  
that favours you and i  
we have both of us between us  
known misfortune in our days  
darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
  
life, oh life is a chance  
we were the only two who spun the wheel  
and never scored romance  
if we'd stayed to play for fortune  
we'd have broke the banks of gold  
we'd have taken old las vegas  
for every cent that she could hold  
love like ours was made in heaven  
it was blessed by lord above  
we will spend our lives together  
forever hand in glove  
we have both of us between us  
known misfortune in our days  
darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we won't ever throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
we are here  
here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'cause we're here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away  
so we are here  
and here we'll stay  
we will never throw this love of ours away...

so at last you're free  
it's the way you wanted it to be  
and the price you paid  
to become a woman of today  
is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
does it hurt when they ask for daddy  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
(yes you can)  
  
so you're free at last  
and beginning to forget the past  
does it make you sad  
when you think about the life you ha-ha-had  
but you're right, you had to take a second chance  
so you fight to find your freedom  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
what's the matter with you  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
don't you know what to do  
(yes you do)  
(yes you do yes you do)  
(yes you do yes you do)  
  
hey hey helen  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen  
can you make it alone  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
what's the matter with you  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
don't you know what to do  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)  
now you live on your own  
hey hey helen (hey hey helen)

you feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
when it's bad, worse, worst  
(and when you're feeling so bad)  
and you think you're cursed  
(and you've got it sad)  
well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
my friend sam is a chauffeur, annie goes to school  
jerry works at the office, sue lies by the pool  
but on all weekends  
(together again)  
when i meet my friends  
(i'm gonna see them now)  
and we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
you paint your world and use all colors  
and then you find it all comes out too bright  
you know it's only a lie  
the songs you sing are too romantic  
and when you want the truth  
they only spit in your eye  
oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
you feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
when it's bad, worse, worst  
(you know you're feeling so bad)  
and you think you're cursed  
(and you've got it sad)  
well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
it's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul  
there's gotta be rock'n roll  
to fill the hole in your soul

honey honey, how you thrills me, ah-hah, honey honey

i'd heard about you before  
i wanted to know some more  
and now i know what they mean, you're a love machine  
oh, you make me dizzy  
  
honey honey, let me feel it, ah-hah, honey honey  
honey honey, don't conceal it, ah-hah, honey honey  
the way that you kiss goodnight (the way that you kiss me goodnight)  
the way that you hold me tight (the way that you're holding me tight)  
i feel like i want to sing when you do your thing  
  
i don't want to hurt you, baby, i don't want to see you cry  
so stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
but i'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me  
there's no other place in this world where i rather would be  
  
honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
you look like a movie star (you look like a movie star)  
but i know just who you are (i know just who you are)  
and, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
so stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
there's no other place in this world where i rather would be  
  
honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
i heard about you before  
i wanted to know some more  
and now i know what they mean, you're a love machine

i am just a girl  
one among the others, nothing much to say  
plain and simple girl  
not a special type in any way  
just one look and you will surely see  
that the true miss nobody is me  
it's an evil world  
that has only made me a girl  
  
i am just a girl  
not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
just another girl  
no one ever looks at in the street  
but today i can't believe it's true  
when you smiled and whispered, i love you  
darling i could see  
i was meant to be your girl  
  
it's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
and thinking that he'll never look your way  
but then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
it's so much more than any words can say  
  
i am just a girl  
not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
just another girl  
no one ever looks at in the street  
but today i can't believe it's true  
when you smiled and whispered, i love you  
darling i could see  
i was meant to be your girl  
  
la, la, la, la la  
  
but today i can't believe it's true  
when you smiled and whispered, i love you  
darling i could see  
i was meant to be your girl

i am the city, you let me be  
i am the city  
  
coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  
and i'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
and you find me beautiful and irresistible  
a kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
and you feel a strange attraction  
the air is vibrant and electrified  
welcome to me here i am, my arms are open wide  
  
somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
and a million voices blend into a single voice  
and you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
people come and take their chances  
sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
i'm the street you walk  
the language you talk  
i am the city  
the skyline is me and the energy  
i am the city  
the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
and the funny smells  
and the turmoil, the cars and the people  
the air that you're breathing is me  
yes i am the city, you let me be  
  
people feed me with their lives i have a hungry soul  
and they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
every day i knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
but come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
dazzled by the crazy magic  
they're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
and in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
i'm the street you walk  
the language you talk  
i am the city  
the skyline is me and the energy  
i am the city  
the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
and the funny smells  
and the turmoil, the cars and the people  
the parks and the squares that you see  
all the sounds that you hear  
and the air that you're breathing is me  
yes i am the city, you let me be  
  
i am the city  
you let me be  
i am the city  
  
the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
and the funny smells  
and the turmoil the cars and the people  
the air that you're breathing is me  
  
coming through a cloud  
you're looking at me from above  
and i'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
i'm the street you walk  
the language you talk  
i am the city  
yes i am the city, you let me be  
  
and you find me beautiful and irresistible  
a kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
the skyline is me and the energy  
i am the city  
you let me be  
  
somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
and a million voices blend into a single voice  
and you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
the skyline is me and the energy  
i am the city  
you let me be  
  
somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats

i have a dream, a song to sing  
to help me cope with anything  
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
you can take the future even if you fail  
i believe in angels  
something good in everything i see  
i believe in angels  
when i know the time is right for me  
i'll cross the stream, i have a dream  
  
i have a dream, a fantasy  
to help me through reality  
and my destination makes it worth the while  
pushing through the darkness still another mile  
i believe in angels  
something good in everything i see  
i believe in angels  
when i know the time is right for me  
i'll cross the stream, i have a dream  
i'll cross the stream, i have a dream  
  
i have a dream, a song to sing  
to help me cope with anything  
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
you can take the future even if you fail  
i believe in angels

i believe in angels  
when i know the time is right for me  
i'll cross the stream, i have a dream  
i'll cross the stream, i have a dream

i'm hearing images, i'm seeing songs  
no poet has ever painted  
voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
so strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
i let the music speak with no restrains  
i let my feelings take over  
carry my soul away, into the world  
where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
where my mind is like an open window  
where the high and healing winds blow  
from my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
i let them take me  
  
let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
rustling down an old alley  
and in the dead of night, i find myself a blind man  
in some ancient valley  
i let the music speak, leading me gently  
urging me like a lover  
leading me all the way, into a place  
where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
where i'm one with every grand illusion  
no disturbance, no intrusion  
where i let the wistful sounds seduce me  
i let them use me  
  
let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
or the moment when a day dies  
i surrender without reservation  
no explanation, no questions why  
i take it to me and let it flow through me  
yes, i let the music speak  
i let the music speak

i saw it in the mirror  
i saw it in my face  
that i'm no longer needed  
anyone can take my place  
i saw it in the mirror  
when i looked into my eyes  
'cause something sure is wrong  
when this boy cries  
  
this boy cries  
  
i saw it in the mirror  
my head is hanging low  
and it ain't too familiar  
with the feelings that i show  
i know you say you love me  
but i'm looking through your lies  
it doesn't really bother you  
if this boy cries  
  
this boy cries  
  
i never thought i could cry for you  
but honey, i will miss you  
'til the day i die  
'til the day i die  
  
i saw it in the mirror  
i saw it in my face  
that i'm no longer needed  
anyone can take my place  
i saw it in the mirror  
when i looked into my eyes  
'cause something sure is wrong  
when this boy cries  
  
this boy cries  
this boy cries

this park and these houses, old streets i have walked  
everything dear, will it be here  
one day when i am returning?  
my friends will get married, have children and homes  
it sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
never expecting surprises  
  
i wonder, it's frightening  
leaving now, is that the right thing?  
i wonder, it scares me  
but who the the hell am i if i don't leave it  
i'm not a coward  
oh no, i'll be strong  
one chance in a lifetime  
yes i will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
my friends and my family, this dull little town  
buses i've missed, boys that i've kissed  
everything old and familiar  
  
i wonder, it's frightening  
leaving now, is that the right thing?  
i wonder, it scares me  
but who the the hell am i if i don't leave it  
i'm not a coward  
oh no, i'll be strong  
one chance in a lifetime  
yes i will take it...  
yes i will take it, it can't go wrong

i got appointments, work i have to do  
keepin' me so busy all the day through  
they're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
oh baby, i miss you so, i know i'm never gonna make it  
oh, i'm so restless, i don't care what i say  
and i lose my temper ten times a day  
still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
it's bad, oh, so bad  
  
somehow i'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(if it wasn't for the nights i think that i could make it)  
i'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(if it wasn't for the nights i think that i could take it)  
how i fear the time when shadows start to fall  
sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
even i could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(even i could see a light i think that i could make it)  
somehow i'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(if it wasn't for the nights i think that i could take it)  
  
no-one to turn to, you know how it is  
i was not prepared for something like this  
now i see them clearly, the things that i miss  
oh baby, i feel so bad, i know i'm never gonna make it  
i got my business to help me through the day  
people i must write to, bills i must pay  
but everything's so different when night's on its way  
it's bad, oh, so bad  
  
somehow i'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(if it wasn't for the nights i think that i could make it)

sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
even i could see a light if it wasn't for the nights

guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights

you're so free  
that's what everybody's tellin' me  
yet i feel like i'm an outward bound  
pushed around refuge  
  
something's wrong  
got a feeling that i don't belong  
as if i have come from out of space  
out of place, like king kong  
  
i'm a marionette, just a marionette  
pull the string  
i'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
just as long as i sing  
  
i'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'round and 'round  
i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette  
just a silly old clown  
  
like a doll  
like a puppet with no will at all  
and somebody taught me how to talk  
how to walk, how to fall  
  
can't complain  
i got no one but myself to blame  
something's happening, i can't control  
lost my hold, it's insane  
  
i'm a marionette, just a marionette  
pull the string  
i'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
just as long as i sing  
  
i'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'round and 'round  
i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette  
just a silly old clown  
  
look this way  
just a little smile is what they say  
you'll look better on the photograph  
if you laugh, that's o.k.!!  
  
i'm a marionette, just a marionette  
pull the string  
i'm a marionette, everybody's pet

'round and 'round  
i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette  
just a silly old clown

pushed around refugee

i, i've been in love before  
i thought i would no more  
manage to hit the ceiling  
still, strange as it seems to me  
you brought it back to me  
that old feeling  
  
i, i don't know what you do  
you make me think that you  
possibly could release me  
i think you'll be able to  
make all my dreams come true  
and you ease me  
  
you thrill me, you delight me  
you please me, you excite me  
you're something i'd been pleading for  
i love you, i adore you  
i lay my life before you  
i'll have you want me more and more  
and finally it seems my lonely days are through  
i've been waiting for you  
  
i, i'm gonna make you mine  
you're gonna feel so fine  
you'll never want to leave me  
i feel you belong to me  
someday you will agree  
please, believe me  
  
you thrill me, you delight me  
you please me, you excite me  
you're something i'd been pleading for  
i love you, i adore you  
i lay my life before you  
i'll have you want me more and more  
and finally it seems my lonely days are through  
i've been waiting for you  
oh, i've been waiting for you

(sup-p-per troop-p-per)  
  
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
facing twenty thousand of your friends  
how can anyone be so lonely  
part of a success that never ends  
still i'm thinking about you only  
(still i'm thinking about you only)  
there are moments when i think i'm going crazy  
(think i'm going crazy)  
but it's gonna be alright  
(you'll soon be changing everything)  
everything will be so different  
when i'm on the stage tonight  
  
tonight the  
super trooper lights are gonna find me

(sup-p-per troop-p-per)  
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
so i'll be there when you arrive  
the sight of you will prove to me i'm still alive  
and when you take me in your arms  
and hold me tight  
i know it's gonna mean so much tonight  
  
tonight the  
super trooper lights are gonna find me  
shining like the sun  
(sup-p-per troop-p-per)

feeling like a number one

just a notion that's all  
just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
every move i'm making  
am i reading your mind  
cause it's almost like you're touching me  
there is no mistaking  
just a notion  
that you'll be walkin' up to me  
in a while  
and you smile and say hello  
then we'll be dancing through the night  
knowing everything from there on  
must be right  
  
just a notion  
but somehow i know i'm not wrong  
if it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
but tonight is very special  
it's the night for me and you

well i was looking at a movie on the tv last night  
then i had a very funny notion, yeah  
i really had to write a song about it  
and then i'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n roll band  
and i bet the people gonna like it, yeah  
i know that everybody's gonna shout it  
  
and what a dreadful mighty killer  
a big black wide gorilla  
  
[chorus:]  
we do the king kong song, won't you sing along  
listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong  
we do the kong kong song, gotta sing along  
can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  
listen to the rhythm of the king kong song  
  
now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
we can make gorillas out of people, yeah  
well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  
so people get together, gonna have a good time  
everybody listen to the music, yeah  
'cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
so let your arms hang down  
and waddle all around  
like a dreadful mighty killer  
a big black wide gorilla  
  
[chorus]  
  
like a dreadful mighty killer  
a big black wide gorilla  
  
[chorus: x2]

lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
things that you do, and you know i'm crazy 'bout you  
  
kisses of fire, burning, burning  
i'm at the point of no returning  
kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
caught in a landslide of emotions  
i've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
oh, i'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
kisses of fire  
kisses of fire  
  
when you sleep by my side i feel safe and i know i belong  
still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
losing you it's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
never before did you see me begging for more  
  
kisses of fire, burning, burning  
i'm at the point of no returning  
kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
caught in a landslide of emotions  
i've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
oh, i'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
kisses of fire  
kisses of fire  
  
kisses of fire, burning, burning  
i'm at the point of no returning  
kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
caught in a land-slide of emotions  
kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(i'm at the point of no returning)  
kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
i'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
kisses of fire, burning, burning  
i'm at the point of no returning  
kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
caught in a land-slide of emotions

no more carefree laughter  
silence ever after  
walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes  
here is where the story ends, this is goodbye  
  
knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
there is nothing we can do  
knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
we just have to face it, this time we're through  
(this time we're through, this time we're through  
this time we're through, we're really through)  
breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(i have to go this time  
i have to go, this time i know)  
knowing me, knowing you  
it's the best i can do  
  
mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)  
they'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always)  
in these old familiar rooms children would play  
now there's only emptiness, nothing to say  
  
knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
there is nothing we can do  
knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
we just have to face it, this time we're through  
(this time we're through, this time we're through  
this time we're through, we're really through)  
breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(i have to go this time  
i have to go, this time i know)  
knowing me, knowing you  
it's the best i can do

i wasn't jealous before we met  
now every woman i see is a potential threat  
and i'm possessive, it isn't nice  
you've heard me saying that  
smoking was my only vice  
but now it isn't true  
now everything is new  
and all i've learned has overturned  
i beg of you  
  
don't go wasting your emotion  
lay all your love on me  
  
it was like shooting a sitting duck  
a little smalltalk, a smile  
and baby i was stuck  
i still don't know what  
you've done with me  
a grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
i feel a kind of fear  
when i don't have you near  
unsatisfied, i skip my pride  
i beg you dear  
  
don't go wasting your emotion  
lay all your love on me  
don't go sharing your devotion  
lay all your love on me  
  
i've had a few little love affairs  
they didn't last very long and  
they've been pretty scarce  
i used to think that was sensible  
it makes the truth  
even more incomprehensible  
'cause everything is new  
and everything is you  
and all i've learned has overturned  
what can i do  
  
don't go wasting your emotion  
lay all your love on me  
don't go sharing your devotion  
lay all your love on me

long awaited darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes back to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
half awake and half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  
like an angel passing through my room

spring in the air  
the sun was shining  
still the day was cool  
saw her waiting for a bus  
as she was going home from school  
  
looking so cold  
i took her home and  
that was just the start  
we would meet the summer through  
and she was always in my heart  
  
love has it's ways  
like seasons come and go  
and tomorrow there will be another day  
love has it's ways  
and so before you know  
when you turn around it may have gone away  
  
early that fall  
i knew i loved her  
more than anything  
gave her everything i had  
she even got a wedding ring  
  
but in the end  
the mind was restless  
and she had to go  
and the love i'd thought would live  
was buried in the winter snow  
  
love has it's ways  
like seasons come and go  
and tomorrow there will be another day  
love has it's ways  
and so before you know  
when you turn around it may have gone away  
  
love has it's ways  
like seasons come and go  
and tomorrow there will be another day  
love has it's ways  
and so before you know  
when you turn around it may have gone away

do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
ain't heard it a lot since then love  
now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
he leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
but if i would have to choose i wouldn't let you go  
just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
darling i know  
  
we gotta have patience  
love isn't just a sensation  
some of the time it gets rough  
love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
giving love is a reason for living  
but a few things can be tough  
love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
from the first moment i saw you i've treated you like a queen  
i've given you lots of presents  
now listen to that, just look at that cat  
you'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
but if i would have to choose i wouldn't let you go  
just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
darling i know  
  
we gotta have patience  
love isn't just a sensation  
some of the time it gets rough  
love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
but a few things can be tough  
love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)

i've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
so i can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
this old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
when you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
you must have a lovelight  
everything around you is lovelight  
and i can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
the lovelight  
everything around you is lovelight  
you're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
i won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
i don't want to lose you, i don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
how i remember the first time we went to movie  
we had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
and i waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
and the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
when you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
you must have a lovelight  
everything around you is lovelight  
and i can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
the lovelight  
everything around you is lovelight  
you're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
i won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
i don't want to lose you, i don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
and i feel so good  
and i feel so right  
and i know that you must have a lovelight  
  
you've got lovelight  
and i can feel your love anywhere  
maybe even when you're not there  
you've got lovelight  
everything around you is lovelight  
you're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
i won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
i don't want to lose you, i don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
everything about you is right  
let it glow and let it be bright  
i don't want to lose your lovelight  
shining like a star in the night

[chorus]  
mamma mia, here i go again  
my my, how can i resist you?  
mamma mia, does it show again  
my my, just how much i've missed you?  
  
yes, i've been brokenhearted  
blue since the day we parted  
why, why did i ever let you go?  
mamma mia, now i really know  
my my, i could never let you go  
i've been angry and sad about things that you do  
i can't count all the times that i've told you "we're through"  
and when you go, when you slam the door  
i think you know that you won't be away too long  
you know that i'm not that strong  
just one look and i can hear a bell ring  
one more look and i forget everything  
  
[chorus]  
  
yes, i've been brokenhearted  
blue since the day we parted  
why, why did i ever let you go?  
mamma mia, even if i say  
"bye bye, leave me now or never"  
mamma mia, it's a game we play  
"bye bye" doesn't mean forever  
  
[chorus]  
  
yes, i've been brokenhearted  
blue since the day we parted  
why, why did i ever let you go?  
mamma mia, now i really know  
my my, i could never let you go

did you see that man in the limousine  
with the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
but she doesn't care, and she never will  
if he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
just as long as he pays the bill  
  
did you see that man with a fat cigar  
he just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
he can choose the wine from a vintage year  
he will drink champagne in his limousine  
where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
just like a spider in a cobweb  
hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
he's never bothered by his conscience  
deals with the devil, 'cause he wants to be  
man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
in the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
but you see that man made a big mistake  
even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
and the money too, all that he can spend  
he can buy the most, nearly anything  
but he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
just like a spider in a cobweb  
hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
he's never bothered by his conscience  
deals with the devil, 'cause he wants to be  
man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
in the middle (in the middle, in the middle)

well, there was me and bobby and bobby's brother  
please take me back to that place  
where i've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
i remember all the games we used to play  
i really do  
and i went to see them almost everyday  
i wanted to  
though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
we were the best of friends  
we found a place in the sun  
a heaven of fun  
  
well, there was me and bobby and bobby's brother  
wildest kids you could see  
we could play together, climbing the apple tree  
yes, there was me and bobby and bobby's brother  
please take me back to that place  
where i've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
they would take me out for football games and such  
they liked to play  
and i guess i didn't like it very much  
but anyway  
i was happy and proud to be with the boys  
being a little girl  
i found a place in the sun  
a heaven of fun  
  
well, there was me and bobby and bobby's brother  
wildest kids you could see  
we could play together, climbing the apple tree

sometimes when i'm mad  
there's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
sometimes when i scream  
there's a voice in me that says, "you shouldn't be so mean"  
oh no, oh no  
part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
yes, i am to myself what jekyll must have been to hyde  
  
we're like sun and rainy weather  
sometimes we're a hit together  
me and i  
gloomy moods and inspiration  
we're a funny combination  
me and i  
i don't think i'm different or in any way unique  
think about yourself for a minute  
and you'll find the answer in it  
everyone's a freak  
  
sometimes i have toyed  
with ideas that i got from good old dr freud  
nothing new of course  
it may seem to you i try to break through open doors  
oh no, oh no  
i just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
'cause it's an explanation to my split identity  
  
we're like sun and rainy weather  
sometimes we're a hit together  
me and i  
gloomy moods and inspiration  
we're a funny combination  
me and i  
i don't think i'm different or in any way unique

i have tried in vain never had success  
so it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
i have lost my only friend  
now it seems i have to start again  
  
merry-go-round  
where am i bound  
with my love and feelings  
merry-go-round  
  
who wants to kiss me  
and hug me and miss me  
yes, who wants to do it  
i wish that i knew it  
  
merry-go-round  
wish i had found  
somebody to care for  
where am i bound  
  
life is so lonely  
if life is just only  
to love with my loving  
goes round and round  
  
looking for someone  
who would want to stay  
i might find her  
with a bit of luck one day  
  
but who knows  
so until then  
i can only try and try again  
  
merry-go-round  
where am i bound  
with my love and feelings  
merry-go-round  
  
who wants to kiss me  
and hug me and miss me  
yes, who wants to do it  
i wish that i knew it

well, you wake up in the morning  
hear the ding-dong ring  
you go marching to the table  
see the same old thing  
see the fork on the table  
nothing in your pan  
if you sing a thing about it  
you're in trouble with the man  
  
let the midnight special shine a light on me  
let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
if you ever go to houston  
well, you better act right  
and you better not gamble  
and you better not fight  
for the sheriff will arrest you  
then he'll take you down  
and before you understand it  
you are prison bound  
  
let the midnight special  
shine a light on me  
let the midnight special  
shine it's ever loving light on me  
on me, on me

i work all night, i work all day, to pay the bills i have to pay  
ain't it sad  
and still there never seems to be a single penny left for me  
that's too bad  
in my dreams i have a plan  
if i got me a wealthy man  
i wouldn't have to work at all, i'd fool around and have a ball...  
  
money, money, money  
must be funny  
in the rich man's world  
money, money, money  
always sunny  
in the rich man's world  
aha-ahaaa  
all the things i could do  
if i had a little money  
it's a rich man's world  
  
a man like that is hard to find but i can't get him off my mind  
ain't it sad  
and if he happens to be free i bet he wouldn't fancy me  
that's too bad  
so i must leave, i'll have to go  
to las vegas or monaco  
and win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...  
  
money, money, money  
must be funny  
in the rich man's world  
money, money, money  
always sunny  
in the rich man's world  
aha-ahaaa  
all the things i could do  
if i had a little money  
it's a rich man's world  
  
money, money, money  
must be funny  
in the rich man's world  
money, money, money  
always sunny  
in the rich man's world  
aha-ahaaa  
all the things i could do  
if i had a little money  
it's a rich man's world  
  
it's a rich man's world

they say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.  
a voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.  
if i explore the heavens, or if i search inside.  
well, it really doesn't matter as long as i can tell myself  
i've always tried.  
  
like a roller in the ocean, life is motion  
move on  
like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing  
move on  
like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning  
move on  
how i treasure every minute  
being part of it, being in it  
with the urge to move on  
  
i've travelled every country, i've travelled in my mind  
it seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time  
and somewhere lies the answer  
to all the questions why  
what really makes the difference  
between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive  
  
like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
how i treasure every minute (la la la la)  
being part of it (la la la la)  
being in it (la la la la)  
with the urge to move on  
  
the morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea  
the crying of the seagulls that hover over me  
i see it and i hear it  
but how can i explain  
the wonder of the moment  
to be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain  
  
like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
move on (la la la la-la)  
how i treasure every minute (la la la la)  
being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
being in it  
with the urge to move on  
  
la la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
like a wind that's always blowing  
la la la la la la-la  
la la la la la la-la (life is flowing)  
la la la la-la (move on)  
like the sunrise in the morning  
la la la la la la-la  
la la la la la la-la (life is dawning)  
la la la la-la (move on)  
how i treasure every minute (la la la la)  
being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
being in it  
with the urge to move on  
la la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
like a wind that's always blowing...  

i've seen it on your face  
tells me more than any worn out old phrase  
so now we'll go separate ways  
never again we two  
never again, nothing i can do  
  
like an image passing by, my love, my life  
in the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
i can see it all so clearly  
answer me sincerely  
was it a dream, a lie  
like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
but i know i don't posses you  
so go away, god bless you  
you are still my love and my life  
still my one and only  
  
i've watched you look away  
tell me is it really so hard to say  
oh, this has been my longest day  
sitting here close to you  
knowing that maybe tonight we're trough  
  
like an image passing by, my love, my life  
in the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
i can see it all so clearly  
answer me sincerely  
was it a dream, a lie  
like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
but i know i don't posses you  
so go away, god bless you  
you are still my love and my life  
  
yes, i know i don't posses you  
so go away, god bless you  
you are still my love and my life  
still my one and only

tried to sneak out without saying  
with my loudest record playing  
ooh, my mama said, "look at this, you haven't done your bed"  
my mama said, "that's a thing that you should do instead"  
  
then i did what she had told me  
dying for my friend to hold me  
ooh, my mama said, "try and get one thing into your head"  
my mama said, "pa and me, we give you room and bed"  
how i want to live my life  
want to live my life  
la-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
in the morning she said "listen"  
ooh, i felt like in a prison  
yeah, my mama said, "i know you've been out again with fred"  
(my mama said)  
my mama said, "don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"  
(my mama said)  
oh i want to live my life  
want to live my life  
la-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
i said i can live without it  
how i wish you wouldn't doubt it  
ooh, my mama said, "if you want to hurt me go ahead"  
(my mama said)  
my mama said, "i suppose you'd rather see me dead"  
(my mama said)  
oh i want to live my life  
want to live my life  
la-la-la, la-la-la, life [repeat: x4]

every day in the morning on her way to the office  
you can see as she catches a train  
just a face among a million faces  
just another woman with no name  
not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
if you knew her i am sure you'd agree  
'cause i know she's got a little secret  
friday evening she turns out to be  
  
nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
this is the moment she's waited for  
just like cinderella, just like cinderella  
nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
this is the part that she likes to play  
but she knows the fun would go away  
if she would play it every day  
  
so she's back every morning to her work at the office  
and another week to live in a dream  
and another row of early mornings  
in an almost never-ending stream  
doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
everybody seems to think she's a bore  
but they wouldn't know her little secret  
what her friday night would have in store  
  
nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
this is the moment she's waited for  
just like cinderella, just like cinderella  
nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
this is the part that she likes to play  
she would like to play it every day  
  
nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
this is the moment she's waited for  
just like cinderella, just like cinderella  
nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
this is the part that she likes to play

i was at a party  
and this feller said to me  
something bad is happening  
i'm sure you do agree  
people care for nothing  
no respect for human rights  
evil times are coming  
we are in for darker nights?  
i said who are you  
to talk about impending doom?  
he got kinda wary  
as he looked around the room  
he said, i'm a minister  
a big shot in the state?  
i said i just can't  
believe it, boy  
i think it's great  
brother can you tell me  
what is right and what is wrong?  
he said, keep on rocking baby  
'til the night is gone?  
  
on and on and on  
keep on rocking baby  
'til the night is gone  
  
over in the corner  
i could see this other guy  
he was kinda flirty  
he was giving me the eye  
so i took advantage  
of the fact that i'm a star  
shook my hair and took  
a casual stroll up to the bar  
and as sure as hell  
this guy was coming up to me  
he said, who am i and  
who are you and who are we  
what's our situation do  
we have some time for us?  
i said, i was not exactly  
waiting for the bus  
he said, if you're going  
somewhere can i come along?  
i said, keep on rocking baby  
'til the night is gone?  
  
on and on and on  
keep on rocking baby  
'til the night is gone

no smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
though i would have liked to begin  
so much that i want to say, but i feel unable  
you leave and you slam the door  
like you've done many times before  
and i cry and i feel so helpless  
  
one man, one woman  
two friends and two true lovers  
somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
one man, one woman  
one life to live together  
one chance to take that never comes back again  
you and me 'till the end  
  
outside i can see the sun trough the open window  
inside everything feel so cold  
what's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
somethimes when i just can't cope  
i cling to a desperate hope  
and i cry and i feel like dying  
  
one man, one woman  
two friends and two true lovers  
somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
one man, one woman  
one life to live together  
one chance to take that never comes back again  
you and me 'till the end  
  
daydreams of a better life, but i have to wake up  
the sound of a key in the door  
you smile and i realize that we need a shake up  
our love is a precious thing  
worth the pain and the suffering  
and it's never too late for changin'  
  
one man, one woman  
two friends and two true lovers  
somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
one man, one woman  
one life to live together  
one chance to take that never comes back again  
you and me 'till the end  
  
you and me till' the end

they passed me by, all of those great romances  
you were, i felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
my picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
and so i dealt you the blow  
one of us had to go  
now it's different, i want you to know  
  
one of us is crying  
one of us is lying  
in her lonely bed  
staring at the ceiling  
wishing she was somewhere else instead  
one of us is lonely  
one of us is only  
waiting for a call  
sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
wishing she had never left at all  
  
i saw myself as a concealed attraction  
i felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
that's how i started the show  
one of us had to go  
now i've changed and i want you to know  
  
one of us is crying  
one of us is lying  
in her lonely bed  
staring at the ceiling  
wishing she was somewhere else instead  
one of us is lonely  
one of us is only  
waiting for a call  
sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
wishing she had never left at all  
never left at all  
  
staring at the ceiling  
wishing she was somewhere else instead  
one of us is lonely  
one of us is only  
waiting for a call  

the summer air was soft and warm  
the feeling right, the paris night  
did it's best to please us  
and strolling down the elysee  
we had a drink in each cafe  
and you  
you talked of politics, philosophy and i  
smiled like mona lisa  
we had our chance  
it was a fine and true romance  
  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
walks along the seine, laughing in the rain  
our last summer  
memories that remain  
  
we made our way along the river  
and we sat down in the grass  
by the eiffel tower  
i was so happy we had met  
it was the age of no regret  
oh yes  
those crazy years, that was the time  
of the flower-power  
but underneath we had a fear of flying  
of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
we took the chance  
like we were dancing our last dance  
  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
in the tourist jam, round the notre dame  
our last summer  
walking hand in hand  
  
paris restaurants  
our last summer  
morning croissants  
living for the day, worries far away  
our last summer  
we could laugh and play  
  
and now you're working in a bank  
the family man, the football fan  
and your name is harry  
how dull it seems  
are you the hero of my dreams  
  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
walks along the seine, laughing in the rain  
our last summer  
memories that remain  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
in the tourist jam, round the notre dame  
our last summer  
walking hand in hand  
paris restaurants  
our last summer  
morning croissants  
living for the day, worries far away...

people need hope, people need lovin'  
people need trust from a fellow man  
people nee love to make a good livin'  
people need faith in a helping hand  
  
man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
to keep him company  
women always knew that it takes a man to get  
matrimony and harmony  
everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
wants some female company

if a man's in love and his woman wants the moon

somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
isn't that what you call a friend  
gotta have love to carry on living  
isn't it easy to understand

put on your white sombrero  
saddle your horse my dear  
and ride off into the sunset  
you'd better go  
for there is no  
place for you here  
like and old fashioned hero  
you stand before me  
you think our life is a movie  
my world is real  
i live and feel  
and i can do without you  
put on your white sombrero  
your red bandana too  
think of this day as a showdown  
goodbye my friend  
this is the end  
for me and you  
now be a bold vacquero  
don't show your feelings  
i'll cry while you're disappearing  
into the night  
all dressed in white  
unchained and free without me  
put on your white sombrero  
like all the cowboys do  
go find a sweet senorita  
somebody meek  
who'll never speak  
harshly to you  
you're such a cavaliero  
proud, never bending  
i want someone who will take me  
just as i am  
i need a man  
who is in rhyme  
with his time  
you'll never take me  
just as i am  
i need a man  
who is in rhyme  
with his time

in the tender light i saw her face  
she was looking so sad and lonely  
someone help me, someone save me

the poster on the wall of a dear friend  
i wish there was a way that i could show you how your songs set me free  
the hero of them all  
you're a legend  
i guess i'll never get a chance to know you  
still you're close as can be  
  
make the bandstand to a dreamland, rubber ball man  
clapping your hands, let your feet dance, rubber ball man  
when you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man!

where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find  
i tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind  
whatever happened to our love?  
i wish i understood  
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good  
  
so when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
s. o. s.  
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
s. o. s.  
when you're gone  
how can i even try to go on?  
when you're gone  
though i try how can i carry on?  
  
you seem so far away though you are standing near  
you made me feel alive, but something died i fear  
i really tried to make it out  
i wish i understood  
what happened to our love, it used to be so good  
  
so when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
s. o. s.  
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
s. o. s.  
when you're gone  
how can i even try to go on?  
when you're gone  
though i try how can i carry on?

frida  
he stands  
towering over me beside my bed  
losing his head  
  
tells me  
i must take him seriously  
droning on the usual way  
he's such a clever guy  
  
and i wonder  
should i laugh or cry  
he's dressed  
in the striped pyjamas that i bought  
  
trousers too short  
gives me  
on his small philosophy  
carries on the way he does  
  
and me i get so tired  
and i wonder  
should i laugh or cry  
agnetha, frida  
  
high and mighty, his banner flies  
a fool's pride in his eyes  
standing there on his toes  
to grow in size  
  
all i see is a big balloon  
halfway up to the moon  
he's wrapped up in the warm  
and save cocoon  
  
of an eternal lie  
so should i laugh or cry  
frida  
strange how  
  
dangerously indifferent i have grown  
cold as a stone  
no more  
pain as there was pain before  
  
far away he rambles on  
i feel my throat go dry  
and i wonder  
should i laugh or cry  
  
agnetha,  
frida high and mighty, his banner flies  
a fool's pride in his eyes  
standing there on his toes  
  
to grow in size  
all i see is a big balloon  
halfway up to the moon  
he's wrapped up in the warm  
  
and save cocoon  
of an eternal lie  
so should i laugh or cry

see me sitting in the palm tree  
looking down at people passing by  
sitting here no-one can harm me  
they just stare at me and wonder why  
no need to bother, i'm gonna stay up here  
whatever happens, i won't let no-one near  
until you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
you really love me, jeanie jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
and in the evening, when the sun goes down  
i'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'cause i love you, jeanie jeanie on my mind  
  
see me sitting in the palm tree  
waiting for those little words from you  
people laugh and point their fingers  
like i was a monkey at the zoo  
but i will stay here, among my coconuts  
so you will know dear, you're everything i've got  
now won't you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind  
  
winds blow, stars glow, i see a light in a window  
dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
see me sitting in the palm tree  
feeling angry at the silly crowd  
no-one else but you can calm me  
you should know by now i'm far too proud  
i need to show you, i've got my feelings too  
you shouldn't treat me like you always do  
so won't you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
you really love me, jeanie jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
and in the evening, when the sun goes down  
i'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'cause i love you, jeanie jeanie on my mind  
  
jeanie jeanie you're so fine  
jeanie jeanie on my mind  
jeanie jeanie you're so fine  
jeanie jeanie on my mind  
jeanie jeanie you're so fine

schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
i watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
and i have to sit down for a while  
the feeling that i'm losing her forever  
and without really entering her world  
i'm glad whenever i can share her laughter  
that funny little girl  
  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
i try to capture every minute  
the feeling in it  
  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
do i really see what's in her mind  
each time i think i'm close to knowing  
she keeps on growing  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
barely awake i let precious time go by  
then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
and a sense of guilt i can't deny  
what happened to the wonderful adventures  
the places i had planned for us to go  
well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
and why, i just don't know  
  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
i try to capture every minute  
the feeling in it  
  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
do i really see what's in her mind  
each time i think i'm close to knowing  
she keeps on growing  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture  
and save it from the funny tricks of time  
(slipping through my fingers)  
slipping through my fingers all the time  
schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

you think you're gonna make me sulk, you and your fancy car, ah-ha-ha  
but i can tell you honey your tricks ain't gonna get you far, ah-ha-ha

you know it's not worth trying  
so long, so long, so long  
so long, so long, so long  
so long, so long, so long

do i hear what i think i'm hearing  
do i see the signs i think i see  
or is this just a fantasy  
is it true that the beast is waking  
stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
in the pale moonlight  
  
in the grip of this cold december  
you and i have reason to remember  
  
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
the songs that you and i don't sing  
they blow their horns and march along  
they drum their drums and look so strong  
you'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
the songs that you and i won't sing  
let's not look the other way  
taking a chance  
cause if the bugler starts to play  
we too must dance  
  
what's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
won't somebody tell me what i hear  
in the distance, but drawing near  
is it only a storm approaching  
all that thunder and the blinding light  
in the winter night  
  
in the grip of this cold december  
you and i have reason to remember  
  
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
the songs that you and i don't sing  
they blow their horns and march along  
they drum their drums and look so strong  
you'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
the songs that you and i won't sing

soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing

let's not look the other way  
taking a chance  
cause if the bugler starts to play  
we too must dance

and when i see the sign that points one way  
the lot we used to pass by every day  
  
just walk away renee  
you won't see me follow you back home  
the empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
you're not to blame  
  
from deep inside the tears i forced to cry  
from deep inside the pain i chose to hide  
  
just walk away renee  
you won't see me follow you back home  
now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
for me it cries  
  
just walk away renee  
you won't see me follow you back home  
now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
for me it cries  
  
your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
still find a way to haunt me  
though they're so small  
  
just walk away renee  
you won't see me follow you back home  
the empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
you're not to blame

summer night city  
summer night city  
  
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
summer night city  
walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
summer night city  
  
in the sun i feel like sleeping  
i can't take it for too long  
my impatience slowly creeping  
up my spine and going strong  
i know what's waiting there for me  
tonight i'm loose and fancy free  
ah-ah  
  
when the night comes with the action  
i just know it's time to go  
can't resist the strange attraction  
from that giant dynamo  
lots to take and lots to give  
time to breathe and time to live  
  
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
summer night city  
walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
summer night city  
  
it's elusive call it glitter  
somehow something turns me on  
some folks only see the litter  
we don't miss them when they're gone  
i love the feeling in the air  
my kind of people everywhere  
ah-ah  
  
when the night comes with the action  
i just know it's time to go  
can't resist the strange attraction  
from this giant dynamo  
and tomorrow when it's dawning  
and the first birds starts to sing  
in the pale light of the morning  
nothing's worth remembering  
  
it's a dream it's out of reach  
scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
summer night city  
walking in the moon light love making in the park  
summer night city  
  
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
summer night city  
walking in the moon light love making in the park  
summer night city  
  
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
summer night city  
walking in the moon light love making in the park  
summer night city

suzy was nine and i was ten  
right at the time when boys like to think they're men  
she used to follow us at school  
we really thought that she was a little fool  
and one day we said to her  
we don't want to hurt you girl  
but you'd better  
  
look for a friend of your own, suzy-hang-around  
better come back when you're grown, suzy-hang-around  
nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
so get off our playground and stay away  
that's all that we've got to say  
suzy-hang-around  
  
suzy went home to mama's arms  
mama said "look, she's never done you no harm  
so get off her back and let her be  
why can't you play together in harmony?"  
we really didn't know what to say  
but as soon as she went away  
we laughed and said  
  
look for a friend of your own, suzy-hang-around  
better come back when you're grown, suzy-hang-around  
nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
so get off our playground and stay away  
that's all that we've got to say  
suzy-hang-around  
  
yes you'd better  
look for a friend of your own, suzy-hang-around  
better come back when you're grown, suzy-hang-around  
nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
so get off our playground and stay away

i'm nothing special, in fact i'm a bit of a bore  
if i tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
but i have a talent, a wonderful thing  
cause everyone listens when i start to sing  
i'm so grateful and proud  
all i want is to sing it out loud  
  
so i say  
thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing  
thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
who can live without it, i ask in all honesty  
what would life be?  
without a song or a dance what are we?  
so i say thank you for the music  
for giving it to me  
  
mother says i was a dancer before i could walk  
she says i began to sing long before i could talk  
but i've often wondered, how did it all start?  
who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
like a melody can?  
well, whoever it was, i'm a fan  
  
so i say  
thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing  
thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
who can live without it, i ask in all honesty  
what would life be?  
without a song or a dance what are we?  
so i say thank you for the music  
for giving it to me  
  
i've been so lucky, i am the girl with golden hair  
i wanna sing it out to everybody  
what a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
so i say  
thank you for the music, the songs i'm singing  
thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
who can live without it, i ask in all honesty  
what would life be?  
without a song or a dance what are we?  
so i say thank you for the music  
for giving it to me

are you sure you want to hear more  
what if i ain't worth the while  
not the style you'd be looking for  
if i'm sweet tonight  
things look different in the morning light  
i'm jealous and i'm proud  
if you hurt my feelings i'll cry out loud  
i'm carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
that's me  
  
are you sure you want to hear more  
would i be the one you seek  
mild and meek like the girl next door  
don't you realize  
i may be an angel in disguise  
it's lonely to be free  
but i'm not a man's toy, i'll never be  
i'm carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
that's me  
  
i don't believe in fairy-tales  
sweet nothings in my ear  
but i do believe in sympathy  
that's me, you see  
  
are you sure you want to hear more  
won't you have a drink with me  
just to see you're not really sore  
i can't help my ways  
i'm just not the girl to hide my face  
i'm carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
that's me  
  
there's a special love  
like an eagle flying with a dove  
i'll find it in the end  
if i keep on searching, but until then  
i'm carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
that's me

i must have left my house at eight, because i always do  
my train, i'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
i must have read the morning paper going into town  
and having gotten through the editorial, no doubt i must have frowned  
i must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
with letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
i must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
the usual place, the usual bunch  
and still on top of this i'm pretty sure it must have rained  
the day before you came  
  
i must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
and at the time i never even noticed i was blue  
i must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
without really knowing anything, i hid a part of me away  
at five i must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
a matter of routine, i've done it ever since i finished school  
the train back home again  
undoubtedly i must have read the evening paper then  
oh yes, i'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
the day before you came  
  
i must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
and stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go  
i'm sure i had my dinner watching something on tv  
there's not, i think, a single episode of dallas that i didn't see  
i must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
i need a lot of sleep, and so i like to be in bed by then  
i must have read a while  
the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style  
it's funny, but i had no sense of living without aim  
the day before you came  
  
and turning out the light  
i must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
and rattling on the roof i must have heard the sound of rain  
the day before you came

i believe your new girl turned you down  
and they say she's pushin' you around  
how does it feel, i guess it hurts your pride  
tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
disaster and disgrace  
the king has lost his crown  
suddenly  
he's clumsy like a clown  
the world is upside down  
the king has lost his crown  
  
was it hard to step down from your throne  
and to know tonight you're all alone  
oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
she doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
disaster and disgrace  
the king has lost his crown  
suddenly  
he's clumsy like a clown  
the world is upside down  
the king has lost his crown  
  
disaster and disgrace  
the word is all around  
suddenly  
he's clumsy like a clown  
the world is upside down  
the king has lost his crown

i've seen you twice, in a short time  
only a week since we started  
it seems to me, for every time  
i'm getting more open-hearted  
  
i was an impossible case  
no-one ever could reach me  
but i think i can see in your face  
there's a lot you can teach me  
so i wanna know  
  
what's the name of the game?  
does it mean anything to you?  
what's the name of the game?  
can you feel it the way i do?  
tell me please, 'cause i have to know  
i'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
and you make me talk  
and you make me feel  
and you make me show  
what i'm trying to conceal  
if i trust in you, would you let me down?  
would you laugh at me, if i said i care for you?  
could you feel the same way too?  
i wanna know  
  
the name of the game  
  
i have no friends, no-one to see  
and i am never invited  
now i am here, talking to you  
no wonder i get excited  
  
your smile, and the sound of your voice  
and the way you see through me  
got a feeling, you give me no choice  
but it means a lot to me  
so i wanna know  
  
what's the name of the game? (your smile and the sound of your voice)  
does it mean anything to you? (got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(but it means a lot)

i wanna know  
oh yes i wanna know  
  
the name of the game (i was an impossible case)  
does it mean anything to you? (but i think i can see in your face)  
(that it means a lot)

they came from the hills  
and they came from the valleys and the plains  
they struggled in the cold  
in the heat and the snow and in the rain  
came to hear him play  
play their minds away  
  
we're all following a strange melody  
we're all summoned by a tune  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon for him  
and we dance beneath the moon  
sub luna saltamus  
  
they came from the south  
from the west and the north and from the east  
they waited for the man  
like a parish is waiting for the priest  
longed to hear him play  
play their minds away  
  
we're all following a strange melody  
we're all summoned by a tune  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon for him  
and we dance beneath the moon  
sub luna saltamus  
  
he gave them a dream  
he seduced everybody in the land  
the fire in his eyes  
and the fear was a weapon in his hand  
so they let him play  
play their minds away  
  
we're all following a strange melody  
we're all summoned by a tune  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon  
we're following the piper  
and we dance beneath the moon for him  
and we dance beneath the moon  
  
and we dance beneath the moon

i hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
the sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
i cannot move, i'm standing  
numb and frozen  
among the things i love so dearly  
the books, the paintings and the furniture  
help me  
  
the signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
none of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
and they don't dare to come here  
anymore now  
but how i loved our secret meetings  
we talked and talked in quiet voices  
smiling  
  
now i hear them moving  
muffled noises coming through the door  
i feel i'm  
crackin' up  
voices growing louder, irritation building  
and i'm close to fainting  
crackin' up  
they must know by now i'm in here trembling  
in a terror evergrowing  
crackin' up  
my whole world is falling, going crazy  
there is no escaping now, i'm  
crackin' up  
  
these walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
and now they've come to take me  
come to break me  
and yet it isn't unexpected  
i have been waiting for these visitors  
help me  
  
now i hear them moving  
muffled noises coming through the door  
i feel i'm  
crackin' up  
voices growing louder, irritation building  
and i'm close to fainting  
crackin' up  
they must know by now i'm in here trembling  
in a terror evergrowing  
crackin' up  
my whole world is falling, going crazy  
there is no escaping now, i'm  
crackin' up  
  
now i hear them moving  
muffled noises coming through the door  
i feel i'm  
crackin' up  
voices growing louder, irritation building

crackin' up (i have been waiting for these visitors)  
they must know by now i'm in here trembling  
in a terror evergrowing

you and i can share the silence  
finding comfort together  
the way old friends do  
  
and after fights and words of violence  
we make up with each other  
the way old friends do  
  
times of joy and times of sorrow  
we will always see it through  
oh, i don't care what comes tomorrow  
we can face it together  
the way old friends do  
  
you and i can share the silence  
finding comfort together  
the way old friends do  
  
and after fights and words of violence  
we make up with each other

times of joy and times of sorrow  
we will always see it through  
oh i don't care what comes tomorrow  
we can face it together  
the way old friends do  
  
we can face it together  
the way old friends do

i don't want to talk  
about the things we've gone through  
though it's hurting me  
now it's history  
i've played all my cards  
and that's what you've done too  
nothing more to say  
no more ace to play  
  
the winner takes it all  
the loser standing small  
beside the victory  
that's my destiny  
  
i was in your arms  
thinking i belonged there  
i figured it made sense  
building me a fence  
building me a home  
thinking i'd be strong there  
but i was a fool  
playing by the rules  
  
the gods may throw a dice  
their minds as cold as ice  
and someone way down here  
loses someone dear  
the winner takes it all  
the loser has to fall  
it's simple and it's plain  
why should i complain.  
  
but tell me does she kiss  
like i used to kiss you?  
does it feel the same  
when she calls your name?  
somewhere deep inside  
you must know i miss you  
but what can i say  
rules must be obeyed  
  
the judges will decide  
the likes of me abide  
spectators of the show  
always staying low  
the game is on again  
a lover or a friend  
a big thing or a small  
the winner takes it all  
  
i don't want to talk  
if it makes you feel sad  
and i understand  
you've come to shake my hand  
i apologize  
if it makes you feel bad  
seeing me so tense  
no self-confidence  
but you see  
the winner takes it all  
the winner takes it all

the city is a jungle, you better take care  
never walk alone after midnight  
if you don't believe it you better beware  
of me  
  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
people who fear me never go near me, i am the tiger  
  
the city is a nightmare, a horrible dream  
some of us will dream it forever  
look around the corner and try not to scream  
it's me  
  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
people who fear me never go near me, i am the tiger  
  
yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
people who fear me never go near me, i am the tiger  
  
the city is a prison, you never escape  
you're forever trapped in the alleys  
look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
of me  
  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
people who fear me never go near me, i am the tiger  
yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
people who fear me never go near me, i am the tiger  
and if i meet you, what if i eat you, i am the tiger  
i am behind you, i'll always find you, i am the tiger  
tiger  
tiger

he had what you might call a trivial occupation  
he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  
with no romance in his life  
sometimes he wished he had a wife  
he read the matrimonial advertising pages  
the cries for help from different people, different ages  
but they had nothing to say  
at least not until the day  
when something special he read  
this is what it said  
  
if you dream of the girl for you  
then call us and get two for the price of one  
we're the answer if you feel blue  
so call us and get two for the price of one  
if you dream of the girl for you  
then call us and get two for the price of one  
we're the answer if you feel blue  
so call us and get two for the price of one  
  
he called the number and a voice said: "alice whiting"  
the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
he was amazed at his luck  
the purest streak of gold he'd struck  
he said: "i read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
i think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
why don't we meet for a chat  
the three of us in my flat"  
i can't forget what i read  
this is what it said  
  
if you dream of the girl for you  
then call us and get two for the price of one  
we're the answer if you feel blue  
so call us and get two for the price of one  
if you dream of the girl for you  
then call us and get two for the price of one  
we're the answer if you feel blue  
so call us and get two for the price of one  
  
she said: "i'm sure we must be perfect for each other  
and if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother"

don't know how to take it, don't know where to go  
my resistance running low  
and every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
(you know that i'm nobody's fool)  
i'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  
i don't have a strategy  
it's just like taking candy from a baby and i think i must be  
  
under attack, i'm being taken  
about to crack, defenses breaking  
won't somebody please have a heart  
come and rescue now 'cause i'm falling apart  
under attack, i'm taking cover  
he's on my track, my chasing lover  
thinking nothing can stop him now  
but i want to know, should i want to, i'm not sure  
  
this is getting crazy, i should tell him so  
really let my anger show  
persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite "no"  
(i'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
guess i'm kind of flattered but i'm scared as well  
something like a magic spell  
i hardly dare to think of what could happen, where i'd be if i fell  
  
under attack, i'm being taken  
about to crack, defenses breaking  
won't somebody please have a heart  
come and rescue now 'cause i'm falling apart  
under attack, i'm taking cover  
he's on my track, my chasing lover  
thinking nothing can stop him now  
should i want to, i'm not sure, i would know how

went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
and then i heard them laugh and say  
look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
hey, what's it good for anyway?  
so i said  
fellas, like to ask you a thing if i may  
  
what about livingstone?  
what about all those men?  
who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
traveling up the nile  
putting themselves on test  
didn't that help the rest?  
wasn't it worth it then?  
what about livingstone?  
  
and all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
didn't know what to answer or what to say  
so i told them about him, that he was just like  
one of those spacemen in his way  
and if you laugh at them  
then there's only a thing i can say  
  
what about livingstone?  
what about all those men?  
who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
traveling up the nile  
putting themselves on test  
didn't that help the rest?  
wasn't it worth it then?  
  
what about livingstone?  
(didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
what about all those men?  
(didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
tell me, wasn't it worth the while

here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
birds of passage, you and me  
we fly instinctively  
when the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
in our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
we're still striving for the sky  
no taste for humble pie  
thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
it's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
how you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
clear-headed and open-eyed  
with nothing left untried  
standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
there's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
there's no hurry any more when all is said and done

everybody screamed when i kissed the teacher  
and they must have thought they dreamed when i kissed the teacher  
all my friends at school  
they had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
when i kissed the teacher  
couldn't quite believe his eyes, when i kissed the teacher  
my whole class went wild  
as i held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
i was in the seventh heaven when i kissed the teacher  
  
one of these days  
gonna tell him i dream of him every night  
one of these days  
gonna show him i care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
i was in a trance when i kissed the teacher  
suddenly i took the chance when i kissed the teacher  
leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
and i couldn't help it, i just had to kiss the teacher  
  
one of these days  
gonna tell him i dream of him every night  
one of these days  
gonna show him i care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
what a crazy day, when i kissed the teacher  
all my sense had flown away when i kissed the teacher  
my whole class went wild  
as i held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
i was in the seventh heaven when i kissed the teacher  
(i want to hug, hug, hug him)  
when i kissed the teacher  
(i want to hug, hug him)  
when i kissed the teacher  
(i want to hug, hug, hug him)  
when i kissed the teacher  
(i want to hug, hug him)  
when i kissed the teacher  
(i want to hug, hug, hug him)

when you were lonely, you needed a man  
someone to lean on, well i understand  
it's only natural  
but why did it have to be me?  
nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
so you were looking for someone to hold  
that's only natural  
but why did it have to be me?  
  
i was so lonesome, i was blue  
i couldn't help it, it had to be you and i  
always thought you knew the reason why  
i only wanted a little love affair  
now i can see you are beginning to care  
but baby, believe me  
it's better to forget me  
  
men are toys in the game that you play  
when you get tired, you throw them away  
that's only natural  
but why did it have to be me?  
falling in love with a woman like you  
happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
it's only natural  
but why did it have to be me?  
  
i was so lonesome, i was blue  
i couldn't help it, it had to be you and i  
always thought you knew the reason why  
i only wanted a little love affair  
now i can see you are beginning to care  
but baby, believe me  
it's better to forget me.

frida now there's a shadow falling over our faces  
doubt forever in our hearts  
and in a while we'll start to pick up the traces  
we won't find the missing parts  
  
buy me a ticket, i'll go to the bahamas  
i need a rest from our petty little dramas

a chance to feel the sun  
baby you owe me one  
frida i wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion  
  
i was taken by surprise  
now both of us are in a state of confusion  
hesitation in our eyes  
something unwanted has entered our existence  
  
i think it's better to view it from a distance  
yes i really do  
agnetha, frida aha, mm  
now look what you've done  
  
i'm missing all the fun  
baby you owe me one  
aha, mm

aha, mm  
now look what you've done  
  
i'm missing all the fun  
baby you owe me one  
aha, mm  
it's my turn to run

always have, always will  
i was mesmerized when i first met you  
wouldn't let myself believe  
that you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
but you didn't know  
that secret part of me  
until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
i always have  
even when it didn't show  
i always will  
you know that i just want to touch you  
whenever you're close to me

you know that i just want to show you  
just how much you mean to me  
always have, always will  
  
everything that you give in to  
everything you'll ever need  
is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
you gotta know  
but more importantly  
you've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
i always have  
even when it didn't show  
i always will  
you know that i just want to touch you  
whenever you're close to me  
i always have  
doesn't matter where we go  
i always will  
you know that i just want to show you  
just how much you mean to me  
  
sometimes we try too hard to please  
we should let love come naturally  
and sometimes i don't know  
just what you really do to me  
that is o.k.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
i always have  
even when it didn't show  
i always will  
you know that i just want to touch you  
whenever you're close to me  
i always have  
doesn't matter where we go  
i always will  
you know that i just want to show you  
just how much you mean to me  
always have, always will  
  
i always have

this is a song about a well-known girl  
who was she?  
  
we will never know the answer to that question  
  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
according to a well-known song  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
it was something about their hearts, you used to break  
them, and make them go down on their knees  
on and on again  
  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
according to a well-known song  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
romeo and juliet had another story, but they  
were a single pair, not free like you  
still they got a tragical end  
so many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
passion changes but they will still remember you  
i say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
we'll never know the answer to that question  
  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
according to a well known song  
cecilia, walk in the light  
cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
i've been trying to overcome the mental blocks i've got  
if they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
i wonder

i was born in the shadows  
under the iberian sun  
i was the dawn of the valley  
under the iberian sun  
  
i once was a sinner  
but who was not?  
i really liked to rumble and hustle a lot  
but where is the key monster  
he is not here  
i am just a gatekeeper  
now so sincere  
now so sincere

who am i  
and who do i want to be  
who do i want to be  
who am i  
and who do i want to be  
  
i went down to the river  
trying to find peace in my mind  
in the throw  
i saw you glimmer  
the desire for you made me blind  
i first saw you at the distance  
when the moon's at its height  
i came to get to know you  
a disclosure so bright  
i knew, in my heart  
when your flair made me swoon  
i am just a prisoner  
in search of my tune  
  
who am i  
what is the purpose  
who am i  
from where do i flee?  
who am i  
i'd like to remember  
who am i  
and who do i want to be

welcome my son to your very first day  
so proud to be the one  
who brought you this way  
i love you with all my heart  
and my love is here to stay  
but i can't help worrying  
will you eventually smoke weed?  
  
soon enough you'll be walking  
you and me hand in hand  
the silly words you'll be talkin'  
only daddy can understand  
we'll go out making snowmen  
building castles in the sand  
and all the time i'm thinking,  
will this kid end up smokin' weed?  
  
but time keeps on going  
and you keep on growin'  
you're now six years old  
you're getting so good at your spellin'  
but my mind is always dwellin'  
on the fact that you  
could be the kind of guy  
who grows up and needs  
to smoke weed on the couch  
all the time  
all the time  
  
so answer me this while  
you're lying in your little bed  
why must you insist on bein'  
such a fuckin' pothead?  
there's other things in life  
that can make you feel good  
but you just keep on smokin' your herb  
you can't get enough of  
your precious, precious reefer  
where you getting all this money  
to buy so much hawaiian dope?

[verse 1]  
i will leave my heart at the door  
i won't say a word  
they've all been said before, you know  
so why don't we just play pretend  
like we're not scared of what's coming next  
or scared of having nothing left  
  
[pre-chorus]  
look, don't get me wrong  
i know there is no tomorrow  
all i ask is  
  
[chorus]

hold me like i'm more than just a friend  
give me a memory i can use  
take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
it matters how this ends  
cause what if i never love again?  
  
[verse 2]  
i don't need your honesty  
it's already in your eyes and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
no one knows me like you do  
and since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do i run to?  
  
[pre-chorus]

[verse 1]  
when did it go wrong, i will never know  
i have loved you all my life  
how did it slow down, i go round and round  
thinking about it all the time  
  
[pre-chorus]  
i gave you heaven on a platter baby  
i gave you everything you never gave me  
i never lied and i never faked it  
only wanted for you to save me  
this love, it ain't over yet  
there's too much that i haven't said  
  
[chorus]  
did you find the note that i wrote?  
i hid it in the seam of your coat  
it was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
do you even know i can't let go  
  
[verse 2]  
why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
tell me was it all for the thrill?  
what was i thinking, i gave you everything  
but you still went for the kill  
  
[pre-chorus]  
i gave you heaven on a platter baby  
i gave you everything you never gave me  
i never lied and i never faked it  
only wanted for you to save me  
  
[chorus]  
did you find the note that i wrote?  
i hid it in the seam of your coat  
it was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
do you even know i can't let go  
  
[bridge]  
oooh sometimes i feel like i'm in the dark  
oooh i thought i'd die in your arms  
  
[chorus]  
did you find the note that i wrote?  
i hid it in the seam of your coat  
it was hard to write, i had a lump in my throat  
do you even know that i can't let go  
  
[outro]  
hope you know, i won't let go

found myself today singing out your name,  
you said i'm crazy,  
if i am i'm crazy for you.  
  
sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
turns me crazy,  
but it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
and every time i'm meant to be acting sensible  
you drift into my head  
and turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
tell me to run and i'll race,  
if you want me to stop i'll freeze,  
and if you want me gone. i'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
and make me crazy for you.  
crazy for you.  
  
lately with this state i'm in i can't help myself but spin.  
i wish you'd come over,  
send me spinning closer to you.  
  
my oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
strips me down bare  
and gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
i keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
but the more i do,  
the crazier i turn into.  
  
pacing floors and opening doors,  
hoping you'll walk through  
and save me boy,  
because i'm too crazy for you.  
crazy for you

daydreamer  
sitting on the sea  
soaking up the sun  
he is a real lover  
and making up the past  
feeling up his girl  
like he's never felt a figure before  
  
a jaw dropper  
looks good when he walks  
is the subject of their talk  
he would be hard to chase  
but good to catch  
and he could change the world  
with his hands behind his back, oh  
  
you can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
waiting for a surprise  
and he will feel like he's been there for hours  
and you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
daydreamer  
with eyes that make you melt  
he lends his coat for shelter  
plus he's there for you  
when he shouldn't be  
but he stays all the same  
waits for you  
then sees you through  
  
there's no way i  
could describe him  
what i'll say is  
just what i'm hoping for  
  
but i will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
waiting for a surprise  
and he will feel like he's been there for hours  
and i can tell that he'll be there for life  
and i can tell that he'll be there for life

[verse 1]  
hello, it's me  
i was wondering if after all these years  
you'd like to meet, to go over  
everything  
they say that time's supposed to heal ya  
but i ain't done much healing  
  
hello, can you hear me?  
i'm in california dreaming about who we used to be  
when we were younger and free  
i've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
[pre-chorus 1]  
there's such a difference between us  
and a million miles  
  
[chorus]  
hello from the other side  
i must've called a thousand times to tell you  
i'm sorry, for everything that i've done  
but when i call you never seem to be home  
  
hello from the outside  
at least i can say that i've tried to tell you  
i'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[verse 2]  
hello, how are you?  
it's so typical of me to talk about myself  
i'm sorry, i hope that you're well  
did you ever make it out of that town  
where nothing ever happened?  
  
[pre-chorus 2]  
it's no secret  
that the both of us are running out of time  
  
[chorus]  
hello from the other side  
i must've called a thousand times to tell you  
i'm sorry, for everything that i've done  
but when i call you never seem to be home  
  
hello from the outside  
at least i can say that i've tried to tell you  
i'm sorry, for breaking your heart

[verse 1]  
i want every single piece of you  
i want your heaven and your oceans too  
treat me soft but touch me cruel  
i wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
bring the floor up to my knees  
let me fall into your gravity  
then kiss me back to life to see  
your body standing over me  
  
[pre-chorus]  
baby, don't let the lights go down  
baby, don't let the lights go down  
baby, don't let the lights go down  
lights go down, lights go down  
lights go down, lights go down  
down, down, down  
  
[chorus]  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight  
don't let go, baby give me light  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight  
don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[verse 2]  
i love the way your body moves  
towards me from across the room  
brushing past my every groove  
no one has me like you do  
baby, bring your heart, i'll bring my soul  
but be delicate with my ego  
i wanna step into your great unknown  
with you and me setting the tone  
  
[pre-chorus]  
baby don't let the lights go down  
baby don't let the lights go down  
baby don't let the lights go down  
lights go down, lights go down  
lights go down, lights go down  
down, down, down  
  
[chorus]  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight  
don't let go, baby give me light  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight  
don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[bridge]  
we play so dirty in the dark  
cause we are living worlds apart  
it only makes it harder, baby  
it only makes it harder, baby  
harder baby, harder baby  
  
[chorus]  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight  
don't let go, baby give me light  
i miss you when the lights go out  
it illuminates all of my doubts  
pull me in, hold me tight

[outro]  
i miss you, i miss you  
i miss you, i miss you  
i miss you, i miss you  
i miss you, i miss you

right under my feet there's air made of bricks  
pulls me down turns me weak for you  
i find myself repeating like a broken tune  
and i'm forever excusing your intentions  
that i give in to my pretendings  
which forgive you each time  
without me knowing  
they melt my heart to stone  
  
[chorus]  
and i hear your words that i made up  
you say my name like there could be an us  
i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love  
i'm the only one in love  
  
each and every time i turn around to leave  
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
so desperately i try to link it with my head  
but instead i fall back to my knees  
as you tear your way right through me  
i forgive you once again  
without me knowing  
you've burnt my heart to stone  
  
and i hear your words that i made up  
you say my name like there could be an us  
i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love  
i'm the only one in love  
  
why do you steal my hand  
whenever i'm standing my own ground  
you build me up, then leave me dead  
  
i hear your words you made up  
i say your name like there should be an us  
i best tidy up my head i'm the only one, in love  
i'm the only one in love

picture perfect memories,  
scattered all around the floor.  
reaching for the phone cause, i can't fight it anymore.  
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind.  
for me it happens all the time.  
  
it's a quarter after one, i'm all alone and i need you now.  
said i wouldn't call, but i lost all control and i need you now.  
and i don't know how i can do without, i just need you now.  
  
another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind.  
for me it happens all the time.  
  
it's a quarter after one, i'm a little drunk,  
and i need you now.  
said i wouldn't call but i lost all control and i need you now.  
and i don't know how i can do without, i just need you now.  
  
yes i'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
it's a quarter after one, i'm all alone and i need you now.  
and i said i wouldn't call but i'm a little drunk and i need you now.  
and i don't know how i can do without, i just need you now.  
i just need you now.  
oh baby i need you now.

sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
it cuts through the deepest parts of me  
and fills up my mouth with words that i cry  
how i'm still trying to stay inside  
hearts break and hearts wait  
to make us grow from dust  
then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
so that we know that it hurts  
our hearts break and hearts wait  
to make us grow from dust  
then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
so that we know that it hurts  
every now and then my memories ache  
with the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
but as time goes on and my age gets older  
i love the ones i know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'cause heart break and hearts wait  
to make us grow from dust  
then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
so that we know that it hurts  
our hearts break and hearts wait  
to make us grow from dust  
then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
so that we know that it hurts  
you know when to make me, i might just your heal  
you know when to make me, i might just your heal  
you know when to make me, i might just your heal  
you know when to make me, i might just your heal  

i heard, that you're settled down  
that you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
i heard, that your dreams came true  
i guess she gave you things  
i didn't give to you  
  
old friend, why are you so shy  
ain't like you to hold back  
or hide from the light  
  
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but i  
couldn't stay away i couldn't fight it  
i had hoped you'd see my face  
and that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
never mind i'll find someone like you  
i wish nothing but the best  
for you too, don't forget me  
i beg, i'll remember you say  
sometimes it lasts in love  
but sometimes it hurts instead  
sometimes it lasts in love  
but sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
you know how the time flies  
only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
we were born and raised  
in a summer haze bound by the surprise  
of our glory days  
  
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but i  
couldn't stay away i couldn't fight it  
i hoped you'd see my face  
and that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
never mind i'll find someone like you  
i wish nothing but the best for you too  
don't forget me i beg, i'll remember you say  
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
nothing compares no worries or cares  
regrets and mistakes their memories made  
who would have known how bittersweet  
this would taste  
  
never mind i'll find someone like you  
i wish nothing but the best for you  
don't forget me i beg, i'll remember you say  
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
never mind i'll find someone like you  
i wish nothing but the best for you too  
don't forget me i beg, i'll remember you say  
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

[verse 1]  
in the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
from the deepest part of my regret  
i hear the words i wish i'd said  
at the dawning of the day  
i can't wait to see the light  
make up memories in my head  
they help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[hook]  
i can't drown in your tears  
i won't face your fears  
i need to fight my own

you'll never see me again oh baby in time  
let the wait take me under  
i know i'll survive  
you'll never see me again

i took a course in hallelujah  
i went to night school for the blues  
i took some stuff they said would cool ya  
but nothing seemed to light my fuse  
but it's all in the past  
like a check that's in the mail  
she was a tall whiskey glass  
i was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
until i met a blind man  
who taught me how to see  
a blind man  
who could change night into day  
and if i can  
i'm gonna make you come with me  
because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
i've had some lovers like a joy ride  
some things are never what they seem  
my heaven's turned into a landslide  
i thank god i woke up from the dream  
because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
the way bees chase honey  
and drink all the flowers dry  
we'll be saving us a little money  
and if that don't do it, yeah, i know the reason why  
don't make no sense lightin' candles  
there's too much moonlight in our eyes  
because here comes the sun  
ain't no surprise  
ain't no doubt about it  
gonna open up your eyes

checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game  
no dice honey, i'm livin' on the astral plane  
feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain  
oh, heads i win, tails you lose, to the never mind  
where to draw the line  
an indian summer, carrie was all over the floor  
she was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
she'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me  
oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time  
know where to draw the line  
hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs  
oh, you told carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long  
heads i win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime  
no dice honey, you're the salt, you're the queen of the brine  
checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
where to draw the line  
  
checkmate, don't be late  
take another pull  
that's right  
impossible  
when you got to be yourself  
you're the boss, the toss  
the price, the dice  
grab yourself a slice  
know where to draw the line

well i woke up this morning  
on the wrong side of the bed  
and how i got to thinkin'  
about all those things you said  
about ordinary people  
and how they make you sick  
and if callin' names kicks back on you  
then i hope this does the trick  
'cause i'm sick of your complainin'  
about how many bills  
and i'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'bout your poodles and your pills  
and i just can't see no humor  
about your way of life  
and i think i can do more for you  
with this here fork and knife  
eat the rich  
there's only one thing that they are good for  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - come back for more  
eat the rich  
i gotta get this off my chest  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - spit out the rest  
so i called up my head shrinker  
and i told him what i'd done  
he said you best go on a diet  
yeah, i hope you have some fun  
and a don't go burst the bubble  
on rich folks who get rude  
'cause you won't get in no trouble  
when you eats that kinda food  
now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
and then they go get stiff  
and they're dancin' in the yacht club  
with muff and uncle biff  
but there's one good thing that happens  
when you toss your pearls to swine  
their attitudes may taste like shit  
but go real good with wine  
eat the rich  
there's only one thing that they are good for  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - come back for more  
eat the rich  
i gotta get this off my chest  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - spit out the rest  
believe in all the good things  
that money just can't buy  
then you won't get no bellyache  
from eatin' humble pie  
i believe in rags to riches  
your inheritance won't last  
so take your gray poupon my friend  
and shove it up your ass  
eat the rich  
there's only one thing that they are good for  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - come back for more  
eat the rich  
i gotta get this off my chest  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - spit out the rest  
eat the rich  
there's only one thing that they are good for  
eat the rich  
take one bite now - come back for more  
eat the rich  
don't stop me now, i'm goin' crazy  
eat the rich  
that's my idea of a good time baby

the streets were cold and barren  
the nights were dark and dank  
and the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....  
the buildings were dead and the alleys  
stunk from things that used to live there  
ahhh that wasn't the city i remembered  
  
a child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
with not a scrap left on the plate  
and so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
cause the only thing left was their faith  
and there sure as hell ain't much i can do  
about it....  
  
there's a meltdown in the sky  
there's a new day comin' and i don't know why  
there's a fear that gets me high  
and the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by....  
  
so sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
made me wonder just who was the foe  
and was it all to come true what nostradamus  
had predicted such a long long time ago?  
you could hear screams and moanin'  
from the people atoning  
for their sins of a guilt ridden life  
and the final door shuts  
from the wind that leaves cuts  
from the edge on the blade of god's knife  
and there sure as hell ain't much i can do about....  
  
there's a melt down in the sky  
there's a new day comin and i don't know why  
there's a tear stuck in my eye  
there's a new day comin' and i don't know why  
  
battle lines had been drawn  
mother nature how she cried  
by her side, till the dawn  
couldn't kill her if they tried  
how they tried, open eyed, genocide  
then... she died  
  
battle lines had been drawn

there's a meltdown in the sky  
there's a new day comin' and i don't know why

since you got your hooks in me  
  
i ain't never loved a girl  
i ain't never loved a girl  
ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
what am i gonna do about it  
i tell you i'm gonna hold on to her  
i'm gonna hold on to her

blood stains the ivorys  
of my daddy's baby grand  
i ain't seen no daylight  
since we started this band  
no more, no more  
no more, no more  
  
store bought clothes  
fallin' appart at the seams  
tea leaf readin' gypsies  
fortune tellin' my dreams  
  
no more, no more  
no more, no more  
  
holiday inns, lock the door with a chain  
you love it and you hate it  
but to me they're all the same  
  
no more, no more  
no more, no more  
  
baby i'm a dreamer  
found my horse and carriage  
  
stalemate jailbait  
ladies can't refuse  
you love 'em then you leave 'em  
with your sold out reviews  
  
no more, no more  
no more, no more  
  
sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease  
slippin' with her lips  
slidin' down your knees  
  
no more, no more  
no more, no more  
  
baby i'm a screamer  
bound to a wife in marriage  
baby, i'm a dreamer  
found my horse and carriage  
  
ladies hold the aces  
and their lovers call it passion  
the men call it pleasure  
but to me it's old fashioned  
  
times they're a changin'  
nothin' ever stands still  
if i don't stop changin'  
i'll be writin' out my will  
  
it's the same old story  
never get a second chance  
for a dance to the top of the hill  
  
baby i'm a dreamer  
found my horse and carriage

nineteen seventy one  
we all heard the starters gun  
new york is such a pity  
but at max's kansas city we won  
  
we all shot the shit at the bar  
with johnny o'toole and his scar  
and then old clive davis said  
i'm surely gonna make us a star  
i'm gonna make you a star  
just the way you are  
  
but with all his style  
i could see in his eyes  
that we is goin' to trial  
  
it was no surprise  
  
the boys kept kickin' ass  
as usual time would tell  
but some bitch in the choir  
threw water on the fires of hell  
she loved to show and tell  
lord she loved to tell  
  
but with all our style  
you could see in our eyes  
that we is still on trial  
  
and it was no surprise  
no surprise  
no surprise  
no surprise  
  
midnight lady  
situation fetal  
vaccinate your ass  
with a photograph needle  
  
i say  
look it here  
friend of mine  
scratch like you need calomine  
flamingo boots  
sole's a creakin'  
still in love and puerto rican too  
  
ridin' on the wheels of hell  
smokin' in our axle grease  
oh the backstage is rockin'  
and we're coppin' from the local police  
that's right the local police  
or the justice of peace  
  
but with all our style  
you could see in our eyes  
that we is still on trial  
  
baby it's no surprise  
no surprise  
no surprise  
no surprise  
  
rock and roll  
junkie whore  
got my foot inside the door  
knock, knock, knock, knock, knock  
nobody's keepin' score  
  
bad times  
go away  
come again some other day  
topaz and sazzafrazz  
will keep the blues away  
  
candy store  
rock and roll  
corporation jellyroll  
play the singles it ain't me  
it's programmed insanity  
  
you ascap  
if bmi  
could ever make a mountain fly  
if japanese can boil teas  
then where the fuck's my royalties

lord i must be dreamin'  
what else could this be  
everybody's screamin'  
runnin' for the sea  
  
holy lands are sinkin'  
birds take to the sky  
the prophets all are stinkin' drunk  
i know the reason why  
  
eyes are full of desire  
mind is so ill at ease  
everything is on fire  
shit piled up to the knees  
  
out of rhyme or reason  
everyone's to blame  
children of the season  
don't be lame  
  
sorry  
you're so sorry  
don't be sorry  
  
man has known  
and now he's blown it  
upside down  
and hell's the only sound  
we did an awful job  
and now they say  
it's nobody's fault  
  
old san andreas  
seven years ago  
shove it up their richters  
red lines stop and go  
  
noblemen of courage  
listen with their ears  
spoke but how discouragin'  
when no one really hears  
  
one of these days you'll be sorry  
too many houses on the stilt  
three million years or just a story  
four on the floor up to the hilt  
  
out of rhyme or reason  
everyone's to blame  
children of the season  
don't be lame  
  
sorry  
you're so sorry  
don't be sorry  
  
man has known  
and now he's blown it  
upside down  
and hell's the only sound  
we did an awful job  
and now we're just a little too late  
  
eyes are full of desire  
mind is so ill at ease  
everything is on fire  
shit piled up in debris  
  
california showtime  
five o'clock's the news  
said everybody's concubine  
was prone to take a snooze  
  
sorry  
you're so sorry  
don't be sorry  
  
man has known  
and now he's blown it  
upside down  
and hell's the only sound  
we did an awful job  
and now we're just a little too late

these days are slipping away like thieves in the night  
i try to hold on to them with all my might  
precious time spent with you goes by much too fast  
like snow in the sun it just never seems to last  
  
another tasteless coffee  
another empty day  
suddenly last night is just so far away  
too many talking heads  
what was it that they said  
when we're apart the days are dark  
when i'm with you i'm in the light  
  
you're my oasis in the night, yeah  
you're my oasis in the night  
you're my oasis in the night  
you keep our love light shinning bright  
you're my oasis in the night, yeah  
  
when you're in my arms you keep the world at bay  
you stop it at the door  
i don't care what they say  
time's too short  
the fire's too hot  
don't know what to do  
'cause i know in a flash  
it's just a memory too  
  
another tasteless coffee  
another empty day

with only myself to blame

once is enough, it's one time too many  
the changes are rough, oh, once is enough  
  
love went trough such sudden change  
taken a turn for the worst  
the joy turned to fear  
the pain got so severe  
lord, i thought i was cursed  
  
get what you give  
it comes around full circle  
oh, i paid the price  
love so fast  
i won't make the same mistake twice

changes are rough, oh, once is enough  
changes are rough, oh, once is enough
